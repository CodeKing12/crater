We bring to You
Our sacrifice of praise

With the fruits of our lips

Giving thanks unto Your name

I worship you

With all my heart

I lift my hands

With all my heart

I love You Lord

With all my heart

I give You praise

With all my heart

I sing my song

With all my heart

I take the world

With all my heart

I give You praise

With all my heart

Halleluyah

With all my heart

Oh Oh Oh Oh
