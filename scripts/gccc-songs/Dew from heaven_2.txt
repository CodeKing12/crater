My father called me and said hear the words of heaven over you
The earth will yield to you in plenty
The heavens rain down Favour
Receive your father

The mighty hand of Favor
Your father
The nations bow their heads
Cursed are the ones who curse you
And those who bless you blessed

Dew from heaven
Fatness of the earth
Grain and wine 2x
Blessings from above
Grain and wine
Blessings from above
