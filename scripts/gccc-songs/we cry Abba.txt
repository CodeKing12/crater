we cry Abba

I cry Yahweh

we cry Yahweh

It's by your blood
It's through your cross
That we are here

we cry Abba

We have found favour before Your
and we lift our hands just to praise

We cry Father

We have found access before Your
and we lift our hands just praise Your

i have found mercy before Your
and we lift our voice just praise Your


We have found mercy before Your
and we lift our voice just praise Your

You are the joy of many generations
Same yesterday, today and forever
We cry Yahweh

I was made for praising You
I was made to sing Your song
We cry Yahweh
