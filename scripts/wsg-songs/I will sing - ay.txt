You reign in all the earth

I will sing of your praise

Every night and every day

He reigns in all the earth

He reigns in all the earth

I will sing of his praise

Every night

And every day

I will sing of his life

I will sing of his goodness

I will sing of his love

Every night night

And every day

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh

I will sing of his praise

Every night and everyday
