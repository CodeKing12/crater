You are Great
So great

You are more than enough

You are Great
You are more
than enough
than enough

oh it is Jesus
yes it is Jesus
it's Jesus in my soul;
for I have touched the hem of His garment,
and His blood has made me whole.

For the Lord he is good
And His mercy endureth forever
For the Lord he is good
And forever His mercy endures
