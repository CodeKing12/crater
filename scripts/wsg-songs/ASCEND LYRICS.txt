Creation groans in anticipation

For sons to get up and take position

There

We must arise

TAG
We are ascend the highest mountain

It is the mountain of the Lord

By the Blood

By the Word

By the Spirit

We bring order

We bring fire

We bring light to a dark generation

TAG
We bring judgment

We bring justice

We bring truth to a lost generation

TAG
We are called out

We are chosen

We are kings we are priests
