Chorus 1
O Great Light of the world
Fill up my soul
I'm half a man here
So come make me whole
O Great Light of the world
Come to impart
The light of Your grace
To fill up my heart

Verse 1
Sometimes at night
When I am afraid
I cover my eyes
And I cover my shame
So here in the dark
Broken apart
Come with Your light
And fill up my heart

Verse 2
The wind of this world
Can push us around
Folding us up
Backing us down
But here in the dark
I'm not alone
So come with Your strength
And carry me home
