MINISTERING
YOUR PRESENCE IS HEAVEN TO ME

Who is like you Lord in all the earth

Matchless love in beauty endless world

Nothing in this world would satisfy

Jesus you are the cup that won't run dry

CHorus
Your presence in heaven to me
Your presence in heaven to me

Treasure of my heart and of my soul

In my weakness you are merciful

Redeemer of my past and presence wrong
Holder of my future days to come

Chorus
Your presence in heaven to me
Your presence in heaven to me

Oh Jesus Oh Jesus o
Your presence in heaven to me

All my days on earth i will wait

Til moment that i'll see you face to face

For nothing in this world would satisfy
Jesus you are the cup that won't run dry
