God give us Christian homes!
Homes where the Bible is loved and taught,

Homes where the Master's will is sought,
Homes crowned with beauty Your love has wrought;

God give us Christian homes!

Verse2
God give us Christian homes!
Homes where the father is true and strong,

Homes that are free from the blight of wrong
Homes that are joyous with love and song;

God give us Christian homes;

Verse 3
God give us Christian homes!
Homes where the mother, in caring quest,

Strives to show others Your way is best,
Homes where the Lord is an honored guest;

God give us Christian homes;
