I will call upon the Lord
For he is worthy to be praised
I will call upon the Lord
For he is worthy to be praised
I will call upon the Lord
For he is worthy to be praised
I will call upon the Lord
For he is worthy to be praised

So shall I be saved from my enemies

The Lord liveth and blessed be the Rock
And let the God of my salvation be exalted
The Lord liveth and blessed be the Rock
And let the God of my salvation be exalted
