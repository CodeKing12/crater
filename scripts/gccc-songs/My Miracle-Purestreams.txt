oh oh oh oh oh .....ah ah ah ah

Your faith lights my day
I'll never be caught in the dark
I've got the life of God
Right inside of me

There's a knowing of my adoption
A knowing of where I belong.
This is my heritage
I'll never be moved

Chorus
I move in your light
I move, you're my miracle
The life of God inside me
Eternal life
He is my miracle.

Bridge
Out of the darkness came light,
Out of pain came strength
I'm free, I'm alive
You are my miracle

Out of the pressure came wine
Out of the fire came gold
I'm liberated, I'm alive
You're my miracle.
