NEW SONG MEDLEY

In all the universes of God

In all the wondrous things that you've done

There's nothing left to prove you have done it all

You are my Universe

We're gonna sing the song of the redeemed

We're gonna sing and shout His praise, we will

For we are born again

We are Christ's redeemed

For we are Kings and Priests

In His righteousness

Though we be here on earth

We are one with the LORD

We're gonna sing the song of the redeemed

For the earth shall be filled

Filled with the glory

As the waters the sea

Rest and remain

Rest and remain on us

Rest and remain

Lord we abide in you

Rest and remain

Rest and remain on us

Rest and remain

Lord we are one with you
