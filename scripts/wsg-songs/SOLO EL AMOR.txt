MINISTERING
SOLO EL AMOR
(ONLY LOVE)

Uh uh uh uh uh uh

For love I'd do almost anything

I'd cross the widest of oceans

For love I'd fly with a broken wing

Just to taste it for a moment

For love  I'd turn back the strongest tide

There's no storm I couldn't waver

Cause it's more than a gleam in someone's eye

It's what holds us all together

But I've only known once in my lifetime

Love in it's purest form

He came here for me

Suffered and then died under a crown of thorns

Solo el amor
(Only love)

Es la salida
(only love can save me)

Limpia construye concibe y procres
(Conquering death and the sting of the grave)

Tan solo el amor sana la herida
(Kingdoms will fall and tongues will cease)

Que alguna vez nos causara el dolor
(But through it all eternity love will remain)

Solo el amor
(Only love)

When all else has failed me

Will take me to places

That I've never dreamed

Healing my wounds and setting me free

There's nothing else worth living for

Solo el amor
(Only love)

Por amor murio crucifecada
(For love the hope of humanity)

La esperanza de la humanidad
(made the lame to walk again)

El amor es al fruta sagrada
(For love he settled the raging sea)

La promesa de la libertad
(And he came the sinner's friend)

For love He drank of His father's cup

With all my shame on His shoulders

And He offered forgiveness

Through His shed blood

Tell me is it any wonder

That I've only known once in my lifetime

Love in its purest form

He came here for me

Suffered and then died

Under a crown of thorns

Solo el amor
(Only love)

Es la salida
( only love can save me)

Limpia construye concibe y procres
(Conquering death and the sting of the grave)

Tan solo el amor sana la herida
(Kingdoms will fall and tongues will cease)

Que alguna vez nos causara el dolor
(But through it all eternal love will remain)

Solo el amor when all else has failed me

Will take me to places that I've never dreamed

Healing my wounds and setting me free

There's nothing else

Nothing else worth living for

Solo el amor
(Only love)

Es la salida
(only love can save me)

Limpia construye concibe y procres
(Conquering death and the sting of the grave)

Tan solo el amor sana la herida
(Kingdoms will fall and tongues will cease)

Que alguna vez nos causara el dolor
(But through it all eternal love will remain)

Only love..
