Verse 1
Jesus Jesus You're the answer
To all I'm searching for
Jesus Jesus there's no question
You're what my heart is longing for

Chorus 1
You're my hope You're my strength
You're my peace in the stormy sea
You're my life my very source
My guiding light wherever I may go

BRIDGE
You're what my heart is longing for
