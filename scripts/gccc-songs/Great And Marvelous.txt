Chorus 1
Great and marvelous are all Your works oh Lord
King of the ages we give You praises
Who will not fear You or glorify Your name
We give You all our praise


BRIDGE
All of the nations will worship before Thee
For You have revealed Your righteous
Deeds to us
You are the only one who is holy
Who will not fear You and who will not praise
Your holy name


Slide (Vamp)
Who will not fear You and who will not praise
Who will not glorify Your awesome name
Who not celebrate all of Your ways
Almighty God
