SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

If I was an Eagle

I would lift myself

Spread my wings and fly

If I was a Lion

I would run into the jungle and give the loudest growl

And if I was the sun yes I would rise early in the morning

And shine my light so bright

If I was an angel I would sound the alarm

For the whole of creation to bow at your feet

If I was a little child I would sing and shout for joy

If I was a stallion o I would use my horse power

If I was a shining star I would illuminate everywhere

If I was the son of a governor

I would make everybody throway salute o

And if I could control the times

I would go back to the Garden of Eden

I would give you the worship that only you deserve

I would look for beautiful names like Aladewura o

Yes I would go on soun and patewoiye gboruko re ga o
