You're the God of this city
You're the King of these people
You're the Lord of this nation
You are

You're the Light in this darkness
You're the Hope to the hopeless
You're the Peace to the restless
You are

There is no one like our God
There is no one like our God

For greater things have yet to come
And greater things are still to be done
Greater thing have yet to come
And greater things are still to be done

You're the God of this City
You're the King of these people
You're the Lord of this nation
You are

You're the Light in this darkness
You're the Hope to the hopeless
You're the Peace to the restless
You are

There is no one like our God
There is no one like our God

For greater things have yet to come
And greater things are still to be done
Greater thing have yet to come
And greater things are still to be done

For greater things have yet to come
And greater things are still to be done
Greater things have yet to come
And greater things are still to be done

There is no one like our God
There is no one like our God

For greater things have yet to come
And greater things are still to be done
Greater thing have yet to come
And greater things are still to be done

Greater things have yet to come
And greater things are still to be done
Greater things have yet to come
And greater things are still to be done
