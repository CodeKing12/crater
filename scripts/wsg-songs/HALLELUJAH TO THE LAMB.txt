Verse 1
Lord I stand in the midst of a multitude

Of those from every tribe and tongue

We are Your people redeemed by Your blood

Rescued from death by Your love

There are no words

Good enough to thank You

There are no words to express my praise

But I will lift up my voice

And sing from my heart

With all of my strength

Giving praise unto the Lamb of God

Bridge
Every knee shall bow

Every tongue confess

That You are Lord of all
