Chorus
You're the wind beneath my sail

You're the voice I hear all the time

You're my comfort you're my joy

Jesus you

Verse
Everytime I think of what you've done

Everytime I think of who you are to me

My heart beats faster

You're my life my love, you're my everything

You are the air i breathe, you are everything

Just you, so i sing this song of praise to you

Chorus
You're the wind beneath my sail

You're the voice I hear all the time

You're my comfort you're my joy

Jesus you

Verse
So I'll sing your praise and I'll worship you

I'll lift my voice to exalt your name Jesus

For all you have done

You've changed my life, you made me new

All i am right now is just for you

Yes you, and I'll love you till eternity


Bridge
Yes i just live to praise you

I lift my all and say I love you

You are everything to me

And I will always Praise you oh Lord
