MINISTERING
BETTER IS ONE DAY

How lovely is Your dwelling place,

Oh Lord Almighty

My soul longs and even faints for You

For here my heart is satisfied,

Within Your presence

I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings

Better is one day in Your court

Better is one day in Your house

Better is one day in Your court

Than thousands elsewhere

My heart and flesh cry out

For You the living God

Your Spirit water for my soul

I've tasted and I've seen

Your goodness and your grace

Right in your presence Lord

I'm filled with joy and peace

Better is one day in Your court

Better is one day in Your house

Better is one day in Your court

Than thousands elsewhere

Suprano: Better is one day...

Alto: Better is one day, One day, one day

Tenor: Better is one day in Your court

Suprano: Better is one day...
Alto: Better is one day, One day, one day
Tenor: Better is one day in Your court

Better is one day in Your court

Better is one day in Your house

Better is one day in Your court

Than thousands elsewhere
