Chorus 1
You are, You are
You are, You are
You are, You are
You are, You are
You are, You are redemption

You are
You are
You are
You are
You are
You are redemption

Verse 1
You are the King inviting the pauper
To come unafraid to the throne
You are the Father watching and waiting
To welcome the prodigal home

You are the Healer embracing the broken
For all who are wounded and weak You are strong
This is Your story
This is Your song

You are redemption reckless abandon
Extravagant mercy and grace unrestrained
Incredible freedom without condition passionate
Infinite love untamed
You are redemption

Verse 2
You are the Judge taking the place
Of the prisoner sentenced to die
You are the Warrior riding to battle
Declaring His love for His bride

You are the Hero arriving in glory
To rescue the captive when all hope is gone
This is Your story
This is Your song

You are redemption reckless abandon
Extravagant mercy and grace unrestrained
Incredible freedom without condition
Passionate infinite love untamed
You are redemption
