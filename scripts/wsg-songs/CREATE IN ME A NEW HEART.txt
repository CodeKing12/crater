I'm walking in authority

Living life without apology

It's not wrong ,dear, I belong here

So you might as well get used to me

My mother may not be the queen

But my father's king of everything

I'm adopted into the family

So I guess that makes me royalty

And he's given me dominion yes

Power over men them yes

Everything I do is blessed

Promised me some great success
