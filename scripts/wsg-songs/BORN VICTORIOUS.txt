MINISTERING
BORN VICTORIOUS

Daily I'm renewed by God's word and I am strengthened

Daily life is beautiful for me

Daily I succeed in every circumstance

And in the name of Jesus I always win

Though challenges come but they can't weigh me down

I don't give up, I'm from above

For the greater one lives inside of me, I am born of God

Challenges come but they can't weigh me down

I don't give up, I'm from above

Yes the greater one lives inside of me

I am born of God

When there's a casting down I am lifted up

Far above principalities I was born victorious

When there's a casting down I am lifted up

Far above principalities I was born victorious

Oh victorious oh oh oh victorious

Yeah yeah yeah victorious, victorious everyday

Oh victorious oh oh oh victorious

Yeah yeah yeah victorious, victorious everyday

Daily I am blessed with the blessings of Lord

And daily I enjoy my life

Though challenges come but they can't weigh me down

I don't give up, I'm from above

For the greater one lives inside of me, I am born of God

Challenges come but they can't weigh me down

I don't give up, I'm from above

Yes the greater one lives inside of me

I am born of God

When there's a casting down I am lifted up

Far above principalities I was born victorious

When there's a casting down I am lifted up

Far above principalities I was born victorious

Oh victorious oh oh oh victorious

Yeah yeah yeah victorious, victorious everyday

Oh victorious oh oh oh victorious
