If I was an Eagle
I would lift myself
Spread my wings and fly

If I was a Lion
I would run into the jungle
And give the loudest growl

And if I was the sun
Yes I would rise early in the morning
And shine my light so bright

If I was an angel
I would sound the alarm
For the whole of creation
To bow at your feet

Kabiyesi olu orun
I have come to give you Twale

To give you Twale

If I was a little child
I would sing and shout for joy

If I was a stallion o
I would use my horse power

If I was a shining star
I would illuminate everywhere

If I was the son of a governor
I would make everybody throway salute o

And if I could control the times
I would go back to the Garden of Eden

I would give you the worship
That only you deserve

I would look for beautiful names
Like Aladewura o

And patewo iye gboruko re ga o
