I need Thee every hour
Most gracious Lord
No tender voice like Thine
Can peace afford

Chorus
I need Thee, oh, I need Thee;Every hour I need Thee;Oh, bless me now, my Savior!    I come to Thee.

I need Thee every hour
Stay Thou nearby
Temptations lose their power
When Thou art nigh

I need Thee every hour
In joy or pain
Come quickly and abide
Or life is vain

I need Thee, O I need Thee
Every hour I need Thee
O bless me now, my Savior
I come to Thee

I need Thee, O I need Thee
Every hour I need Thee
O bless me now, my Savior
I come to Thee
O bless me now, my Savior
I come to Thee

Just as I am
Without one plea
But that thy blood
Was shed for me

And that Thou bids me
Come to Thee
Oh, Lamb of God
I come, I come

Just as I am
And waiting not
To rid my soul
Of one dark blot

To Thee whose blood
Can cleanse each spot
Oh, Lamb of God
I come, I come
