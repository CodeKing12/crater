MINISTERING
IN CHRIST ALONE

Verse 1
In Christ alone my hope is found

He is my light my strength my song

This cornerstone this solid ground

Firm through the fiercest draught and storm

What heights of love
What depths Of peace

When fears are stilled and strivings cease

My comforter my all in all

Here in the love of Christ i stand

Verse 2
In Christ alone who took on flesh

Fullness of God in helpless babe

This gift of love and righteousness

Scorned by the ones he came to save

Till on the cross as Jesus died

The wrath of God was satisfied

For every sin on him was laid

Here in the death of Christ i live

Verse 3
There in the ground his body laid

Light of the world by darkness slain

Then bursting forth in glorious ways

Up from the grave he rose again

And as he stands in victory

Sin

For i am his and he is mine

Bought with the precious blood of Christ

Verse 4
No guilt in life no fear in death

This is the power of Christ in me

From life

Jesus commands my destiny

No power of hell no scheme of men

Can ever pluck me from his hand

Till he returns or calls me home

Here in the power of Christ I

On Christ the solid rock i stand

All other ground is sinking sand
