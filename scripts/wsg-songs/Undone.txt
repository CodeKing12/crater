Verse 1
Here before Your throne of grace
Resting here in Your embrace
My Savior God my truest friend
Where in the world do I begin

Chorus 1
I'm undone I'm speechless
Overwhelmed by You
Your love knows no limits
And I'm the living proof

Verse 2
Many times I drift away
Still Your faithfulness remains
You made this frozen river flow
And I just want to let You know

BRIDGE
Words cannot tell You
How much I love You
All of the things that You are
Lost in this ocean
Of deepest devotion
Lord You have captured my heart
