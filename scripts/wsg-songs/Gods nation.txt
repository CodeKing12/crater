Ain't no reason that should get me scared
Cuz the Lord is my light and Salvation I know it

Situations try to come my way
But the Lord is my Sheperd I shall not want


You gave me everything that I need
(That I need)

There's no where else I'll rather be
( I'll rather be)
No words can contain gratitude that we bring
(That we bring)


Heaven is God's Nation
Every Citizen worshipping in adoration

Nations of the world are peruzed by critics
That's the reason I put my trust in him

Heaven is God's Nation
Every Citizen worshipping in adoration

The Lord is my shepherd so I shall not want
That's the reason I put my trust in him


He's the one that got me smiling everyday
Showed me love in very diffent kindy of ways

Oh yea his love got me tripping still im standing
In his love

And yes his word is never failing im still standing
On his word

He's my light n salvation
He's my very own

He's the light to the nation
Lamb upon the throne

I won't trade him for silver
I won't trade for gold

He's my one and only like days
of old

Oh yeah am standing on his love
Standing on his promises

Standing on his word like
Everything is possible yea
