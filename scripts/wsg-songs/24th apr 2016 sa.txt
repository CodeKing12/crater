I just wanna tell you what I think about you

Yea

I just wanna tell you what I think about you

Jesus oh, oh, oh

You are the first, the last, beginning and the end

In you I live and move and have my being

You hold my world, my life, my future all in your hands

And you knew my name before time began

There is absolutely nothing you can

Absolutely nothing compares to you

I just want to be more like you, I surrender all

Make me more like you

You make all things new

Your love pure and true

Nothing else will do, am in love with you

You are everything, everything is you

You are everything
(You are everything)

Everything is you
(Everything is you)
