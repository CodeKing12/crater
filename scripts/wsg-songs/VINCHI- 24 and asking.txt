His hands are always open,  yeah yeah

His hands are always open, oh oh

VERSE 1
I was 24 and still asking

Why do I think that life is unfair

And why did I have to come in a dark skin

Started feeling God didn't care

Used making all this big steps on my own

Realized i couldn't do it on my own

Then I reached to some friends for some advice

And now my vision slowly shifted from the throne

Slowly started to slip away

A little slumber slowly started to go astray

I lost my self now couldn't even find the way

A mile a day home is a thousand miles away

I lost myself  tryna live up to lies on lies

You stayed with watched over when me closed my eyes

I gave my  life you gave me more than peice of mind

A piece of you you went and gave me all of you

He changed my life

And I no fit to even lie

You gave your life so I no fit to even die

Your word cover so I no to reason Life

E sure for me so I no need to think am twice.

CHORUS
His hands are always open,  yeah yeah

He's hands are always open, oh oh

VERSE 2

I remember when I kept asking

What do I need to do to be loved?

Why is your love for me just an option?

knew I had to stop myself from caring

Coming from a home divided

Didn't have the love of a father to show

I longed for it I even looked for it

But I kept on searching in the  wrongest places

No pure intentions just fun for a moment

One wrong turn you might get more than a warning

Some survive but others get what is coming

May not be lucky to see his second coming

Till I realized I gotta to come to you

Your hands are always open yea yea yea

You gave  me love I couldn't comprehend

Showed me love that's without no end

Nobody can care for me the way you do

That's why I put all of my trust in you

Safest place is when I dwell in you

And you in me

CHORUS
His hands are always open,  yeah yeah

He's hands are always open, oh oh
BRIDGE

Now I have you

I live my life brand new

In Everything I do

I do it just for you

Every step I take and every choice I make

You with me all the way

Till the end of time

CHORUS
He's hands are always open,  yeah yeah

He's hands are always open, oh oh
