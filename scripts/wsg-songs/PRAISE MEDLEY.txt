I know he rescued my soul His
blood has taken my sin

(I am one I am one)

My shame was taken away
My pain was healed in his name

(I am one I am onel)

I'll raise the banner

My lord has conquered the grave

My Redeemer lives

Who taught the sun where to
stand in the morning?

And who told the ocean,
you can only come this far?

And who showed the moon
where to hide 'til evening?

Whose words alone can
catch a falling star?

Now I know my Redeemer lives

All of creation tesifies

This life within me cries

Now I know my Redeemer lives

You are great so great
You are more than enough

Lord You are good and Your
mercy endureth forever

People from every nation
and tongue From generation to generation

We worship You hallelujah
We worship You for who You are

You are good and your mercy is forever (Hallelujah)

Jehovah

You are you are
You are the most high God

You are you are.
