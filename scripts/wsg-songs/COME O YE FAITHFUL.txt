COME ALL YE FAITHFUL

O come all ye faithful,
Joyful and triumphant

Come ye, o come ye to Bethlehem

Come and behold Him,
Born the King of angels

O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord

And He shall reign forever
And ever

Hallelujah

Sing choirs of angels
Sing in exaltation

O Sing all ye citizens of Heaven above
(Sing Hallelujah)

Glory to GOD,
Glory in the highest

O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him
O come, let us adore Him

Christ...

The Lord...

And He shall reign,
He shall reign forevermore
