VERSE 1
Just as I am without one plea
but that Thy blood was shed for me,
and that Thou bidst me come to thee,
O Lamb of God I come, I come.

VERSE 2
Just as I am and waiting not
to rid my soul of one dark blot,
to Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,
O Lamb of God I come, I come.

VERSE 3
Just as I am though tossed about
with many a conflict, many a doubt
fightings and fears within, without
O Lamb of God I come, I come.

VERSE 4
Just as I am poor, wreched, blind;
sight, riches, healing of the blind,
yea, all I need in Thee to find,
O Lamb of God I come, I come.

VERSE 5
Just as I am, Thou wilt recieve,
wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
because thy promise I believe,
O Lamb of God I come, I come.

VERSE 6
Just as I am, Thy love unknown
hath broken every barrier down
now, to be Thine, yea, Thine alone,
O Lamb of God I come, I come.

VERSE 7
Just as I am, of that free love
the breadth, length, depth, and height to prove,
here for a season, then above,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
