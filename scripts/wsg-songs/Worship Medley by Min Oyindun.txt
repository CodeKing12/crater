There is a place of quiet rest

Near to the heart of God

A place where sin cannot molest

Near to the heart of God

O Jesus blest redeemer

Sent from the heart of God

Hold us who wait before thee

Near to the heart of God

Oh Great King

How lovely is your crown of souls

We your trophies are here to worship you

You reign in all the earth

You reign in all the earth

I will sing, of your grace

Every night and every day

We have come to draw draw draw

Draw from you again

Iye e, iye e
