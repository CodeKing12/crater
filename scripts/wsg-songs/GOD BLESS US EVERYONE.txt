GOD BLESS US EVERYONE

Let the stars in the sky
Remind us of man's compassion

Let us love to will die
and God bless us everyone

In your heart there's a light
As bright as the stars in heaven

Let it shine through the night
And God bless us everyone

Till each child is fed
Till all men are free
Till the world becomes a family

Star by star in the sky
And kindness by human kindness

Let me love till I die
and God bless us everyone
