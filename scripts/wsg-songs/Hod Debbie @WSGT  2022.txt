A seed was once asked a question

Why are you so humble to Death?

What exactly is wrong with you?

So she answered;

I did not create myself, Remember?

God did !!!

And if I as a seed will have meaning

Then my spring must direct my ways..

Oh! It's obvious that you can See Something..

What Exactly is it?

Wedding with the Lamb

What day of joy will be

When I shall be done with all this Earthly wiles

And my Groom will come down in his Glorious Train

To have me his pure bride in his loving Arms

And I'll move with him in Glory

To the Throne of Grace

Where no tears nor Sorrows

But Joy fills the Realm.

CHORUS
What a Day to desire

What a race to Run

That I shall be married to my King of Kings

And I'll reign Eternal with him..

VERSE
Jingle the Heaven, your bride is here

Gloriously arrayed and done with Worldly trials

More than minds could think

Let your beauty speak

At this Royal wedding

Let your Light be New

Multitude of Angels Sing with Glorious Tune

Greatest Orchestration

The Gracious Feet's will Dance

Joy Never Ending.. Everlasting Smiles

All the beasts will fly and clap in Swift Accord..

What a Day to desire

What a race to Run

That I shall be married to my King of Kings

And I'll reign Eternal with him..

And as  I walk through that lane of Heaven

With God Holding my Hands

Crowning me with all the glorious gift

And the Heavens painted with endless Joy

Let It be spoken of me

that I was a Humble Seed

That I yielded to the Calling of my Lord

That I fought the good fight of faith and Finished

And Oh oh oh Joy.. Oh Joy..

CHORUS
What a Day to desire

What a race to Run

That I shall be married to my King of Kings

And I'll reign Eternal with him..
