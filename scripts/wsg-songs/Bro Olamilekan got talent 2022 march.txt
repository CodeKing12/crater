Holy words long preserved

for our walk in this world,

They resound with God's own heart

Oh, let the Ancient words impart.

Words of Life, words of Hope

Give us strength, help us cope

In this world, where e'er we roam

Ancient words will guide us Home.

Ancient words ever true

Changing me, and changing you.

We have come with open hearts

Oh let the ancient words impart.

Holy words of our Faith

Handed down to this age.

Came to us through sacrifice

Oh heed the faithful words of Christ.
