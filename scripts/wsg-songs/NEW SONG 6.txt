SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

You have captured my heart

Consumed my heart with your love

If all I say is
(Jesus,Jesus ,Jesus)

That's more than enough

I will celebrate My God

I will celebrate My God

Let His banner be raised

And His glory be seen

I will celebrate My God

Yahweh eh eh eh

You are worthy of my praise

Lord you're worthy of the glory

And the honour Hallelujah

Jehovah you are the most high

Jehovah you are the most high God
