MINISTERING
PUT A PRAISE ON IT

There's a miracle in this room

With my name on it

There's a healing in this room

And it here for me

There is a breakthrough in this room

With my name on it

So am gonna put a praise on it

Am gonna put a praise on it

Ah ah ah

The devil thought he had me

Thought that my life was over

He thought by now I'd give up

He thought I had no more

But that's when someone greater

Stepped in my situation

My morning has now begun...

He turned it

No more crying days

No more hurt and pain

No more guilt and shame

He turned it

No more loneliness

No more fear and stress

No more sadness

He turned it
