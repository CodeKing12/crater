Oh Be lifted

Above all other gods

We lay our Crowns

And worship You

And we will say

That You are good

And all the miracles

You

For we are change

And all the hope we have

We place in You right now

Father we declare that we love You

We declare our everlasting love for You

Father we declare that we love You

We declare our everlasting love for You
