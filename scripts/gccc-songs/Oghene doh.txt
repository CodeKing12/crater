Whenever I call you are there
Whenever I pray lord you hear me
I'm not alone this I know
What can I bring to you lord
But this song of praise

I'm not alone this I know

Kiri doh doh doh kiri doh
For the life you gave me yeah
You brought me close to you
Kiri doh doh doh kiri doh
And you call me your own
What more can I say
