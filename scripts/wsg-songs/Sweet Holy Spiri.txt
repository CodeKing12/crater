Holy Spirit you are in us

I won't cleave to another nor lean on any man

Holy Spirit you are in us

Sweet Holy Spirit

Sweet heavenly dove

You are right here in us

Filling us with your love

And for these blessings

We lift our hands in praise

Without a doubt we know

That we are glorified

When we shall leave this place
