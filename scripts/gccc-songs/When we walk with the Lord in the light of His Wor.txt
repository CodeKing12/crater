When we walk with the Lord
What a glory He sheds on our
While we do His good will, He
And with all who will trust and

Trust and obey, for there's no
To be happy in Jesus, but to

Not a shadow can rise, not a
But His smile quickly drives it
Not a doubt or a fear, not a
Can abide while we trust and

Then in fellowship sweet we
Or we'll walk by His side in
What He says we will do,
Never fear, only trust and

And 'Tis so sweet to trust in
Just to take Him at His Word;
Just to rest upon His promise,
Just to know, "Thus saith the
Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!
Just to know, "Thus saith the

Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him!
How I've proved Him o'er and
Jesus, Jesus, precious Jesus!
Oh, for grace to trust Him
more!
