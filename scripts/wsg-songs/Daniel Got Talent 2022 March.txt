God of Abraham

You're the God of covenant

And of faithful promises

Time and time again

You have proven

You'll do just what You said

Though the storms may come and the winds may blow

I'll remain steadfast

And let my heart learn, when You speak a word

It will come to pass

Great is Your faithfulness to me

From the rising sun to the setting same

I will praise Your name

Great is Your faithfulness to me

When the seasons change

You remain the same

VERSE
God from age to age

Though the earth may pass away

Your word remains the same, yeah

You're history can prove

There's nothing You can't do

You're faithful and true

CHORUS
Though the storms may come and the winds may blow

I'll remain steadfast

And let my heart learn, when You speak a word

It will come to pass

Great is Your faithfulness to me,

From the rising sun to the setting same

I will praise Your name

Great is Your faithfulness to me,

Your faithfulness, it never runs out

It never runs out

Oh-oh, Your faithfulness

Oh, it never runs out

I put my faith in Jesus

My anchor to the ground

My hope and firm foundation

He'll never let me down

Great is Your faithfulness to me

From the rising sun to the setting same

I will praise Your name

Oh, it never runs out

Great is Your faithfulness to me
