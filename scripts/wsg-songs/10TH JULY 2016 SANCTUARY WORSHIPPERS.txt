SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

I will lift up my hands to You

I will lift up my voice to You

And sing a victory song to You

Great and mighty is who You are

Nobody like You,
Nobody like You

Alpha, nobody like You
Omega, nobody like You

Ko se ni bi re
[no one like You]

Oluwa ko se ni bi re
[Lord nobody like You]

Ko ma si,  Ko ma si [none like You]

Ko si ooo,  Ko si ooo [nobody like You]
