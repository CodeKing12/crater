GREAT ARE YOU LORD

Chorus
Holy Holy Lord Almighty

It's a priviledge to worship You

Maker of all universe

It's a honour just to Stand before you

With a greatful heart I lift my hands to you

Proclaiming Lord You reign

Lord you reign

Great are you Lord

Greatly to be praised

Father you reign

We lift our hands
You reign

We Worship you
You reign

Great are you LORD
