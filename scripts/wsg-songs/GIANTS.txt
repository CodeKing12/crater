GIANTS

Giants
Do die

The bigger they are
The harder they fall

Giants
They die

Just walk around
Your Jericho Wall

Now we
Come in Your Name

And we
Stand on Your Word

What is
Loosed in the Heaves

Will be
Loosed on Earth

Now we
Come in Your Name

And we
Stand on Your Word

What is
Loosed in the Heaves

Will be
Loosed on Earth

Let God Arise-

Giants
Die

Giants
Do die

The bigger they are
The harder they fall

Giants
They die

Just walk around
Your Jericho Wall

Now we
Come in Your Name

And we
Stand on Your Word

What is
Loosed in the Heavens

Will be
Loosed on Earth

Now we
Come in Your Name

And we
Stand on Your Word

What is
Loosed in the Heavens

Will be
Loosed on Earth

Let God Arise-

Giants
Die

Your praise
Will bring down strongholds

When you praise
You will see miracles

Just praise

When things

Seem impossible

And the King of Glory
Will show his glory

Let God Arise-

Giants
Die

Giants
Do die

The bigger they are
The harder they fall

Giants
They die

Just walk around
Your Jericho Wall

Now we
Come in Your Name

And we
Stand on Your Word

What is
Loosed in the Heavens

Will be
Loosed on Earth

Now we
Come in Your Name

And we
Stand on Your Word

What is
Loosed in the Heavens

Will be
Loosed on Earth

Let God Arise-
