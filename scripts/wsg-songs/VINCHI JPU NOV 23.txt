Verse
Time and time again

Tried to do it on my own

Thought i believed but all i did was

put my trust in my own hands

Tired of running round in circles

I'ma respond to your word

My faith is built up

no longer a shadow of doubt

Cause I'm one

Verse
You can make mountains move if you believe

Greater is he who lives in me

He said greater works will we do

Greater is he who lives in me

END
Speak in the name

the name of Jesus

Live in the name

Move in the name

PRAY in the name

GO in the name

SEE in the name
