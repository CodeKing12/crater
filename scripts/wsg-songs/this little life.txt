This Little Light of Mine Lyrics

1 This little light of mine,

I'm gonna let it shine.

This little light of mine,

I'm gonna let it shine.

This little light of mine,

I'm gonna let it shine,

let it shine, let it shine, oh let it shine.

Ev'rywhere I go,

I'm gonna let it shine.

Ev'rywhere I go,

I'm gonna let it shine.

Ev'rywhere I go,

I'm gonna let it shine,

let it shine, let it shine, oh let it shine.

Jesus gave it to me

I'm gonna let it shine

Jesus gave it to me

I'm gonna let it shine

Jesus gave it to me

I'm gonna let it shine

let it shine, let it shine, oh let it shine
