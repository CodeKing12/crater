AND CAN IT BE

Verse
And can it be that I should gain
An int'rest in the Savior's blood?
Died He for me, who caused His pain?
For me, who Him to death pursued?
Amazing love! how can it be
That Thou, my God, should die for me?

Amazing love! how can it be
That Thou, my God, should die for me!

VERSE 2
’
Who can explore His strange design?
In vain the firstborn seraph tries
To sound the depths of love Divine!
’
Let angel minds inquire no more.

Let angel minds inquire no more.

Verse
He left His Father's throne above,
So free, so infinite His grace;
Emptied Himself of all but love,
And bled for Adam's helpless race;
'Tis mercy all, immense and free;
For, O my God, it found out me.

'Tis mercy all, immense and free;
For, O my God, it found out me.

Verse
Long my imprisoned spirit lay
Fast bound in sin and nature's night;
Thine eye diffused a quick'ning ray,
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;
My chains fell off, my heart was free;
I rose, went forth and followed Thee.

My chains fell off, my heart was free;
I rose, went forth and followed Thee.

Verse
No condemnation now I dread;
Jesus, and all in Him is mine!
Alive in Him, my living Head,
And clothed in righteousness divine,
Bold I approach th'eternal throne,
And claim the crown, through Christ my own.

Bold I approach th'eternal throne,
And claim the crown, through Christ my own.

Amen.
