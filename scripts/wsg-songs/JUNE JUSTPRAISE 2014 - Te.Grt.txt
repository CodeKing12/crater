Cos you made my life so beautiful

More of you I ask for oh oh oh today

In my life

Cos you made my life so beautiful

I don

Cos since you came into my life

Everything has changed

Now I wanna be with you forever

Beholding your face every day of my life

Praising you with rhythm of my voice

I want you more
More Lord
