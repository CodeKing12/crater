you are the giver of life
Unto you shall the gathering of the people be
There is no where else we will go
No one else we will find
Unto you shall the gathering of your people be
For You alone are the giver of life
From Generation to generation
From generation to generation

From age to age you remain the same
Eternal life is with you
Eternal life is with you

I will look no where else
I will go no where else
And I will seek no one else
Eternal life is with you
Eternal life is with you

You are the God of our fathers
Abraham Isaac and Jacob
Eternal life is with you
Eternal life is with you
Eternal life is with you

I will go no where else
I will look no where else
And I will seek no one else
Eternal life is with you
Eternal life is with you
