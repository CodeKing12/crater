MINISTERING
JESUS SHALL REIGN

VERSE 1
Jesus shall reign where o
Doth his successful journey run
His kingdom stretch from shore to shore
Till moon shall wax and wane no more

VERSE 2
For him shall endless prayer be made
And praises throng to crown his head
His name like sweet perfume shall  rise
With every morning sacrifice.

VERSE 3
People and realms of every tongue
Dwell on His love with sweetest song
And infant voices shall proclaim
Their early blessings on His name.

VERSE 4
Blessings abound where
The prisoner leaps to lose his chains
The weary find eternal rest
And all the sons of want are blessed.

VERSE 5
Let every creature rise and bring
Peculiar honour to our King
Angels descend with songs
And earth repeat the Loud.
AMEN!
