Ever since you called my
I have not been the same
You picked me up
And made my heart brand
Ever since you took my
Oh I am changed
My life

So when the world is
Turnioniown oh oh
I won
Turnioniown oh oh
I won

I won
I won
I won
I won

I live I live I live in you
I live I live I live in you

So when the world is
Turnioniown oh oh
I won
â€™
?t let go oh oh oh oh
