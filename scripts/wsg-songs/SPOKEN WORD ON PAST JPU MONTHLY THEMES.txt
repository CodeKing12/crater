EXPECTATIONS
I have an expectation

The people have a high expectation

of my manifestation

And even the Lord has an expectation of me.

And now I have become a spectacle

A gift

A miracle

And everyone is waiting for the unveiling

Even I, am curious... Expectant.

TABERNACLE
With all this expectations,

I went to the only place I could

Where else would I find answers

Where else would I know what to do

And where else would I make my sacrifices

But for the Tabernacle

A holy Sanctuary

The house of God

For there will I meet with God.

And there will I find all my answers

For His word is always in his Holy place

DEPTH
And so in His Tabernacle

I will search deeper

I will listen more

I will serve with my heart

For how shall it be given to me if I don't ask

How will I find if I don't seek

And how shall the door be opened if I don't knock.

ILLUMINATE
And then I will see the light

And the eyes of my understanding shall be enlightened

I will see clearer

I will understand better

I shall be Illuminated

WEIGHT OF GLORY
And then I shall feed the

expectations of all them that wait

For my  result shall be Glory

For all that the creature waits

for is this weight of Glory!

And the whole earth shall be

filled with this Glory

as the waters cover the sea.

MARVELOUS HELP
And so many are in awe

The whole earth is filled with wonder

I have become the talk of the town

Seating with kings and dinning with Presidents

But I have secret

For after all this successes

I will tell you one truth

I am where I am today

Because I was marvelously helped.
