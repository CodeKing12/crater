The same anointing I know

Worked in Ages and it still works today

TAG
The same God that's in me

the same one that spoke the word

He said let there be and there was

His words formed the universe

he created me

just like him

i'm his light and his glory

he created me

to reign as him

its the same anointing i know

and it still works today

You poured yourself out to me

yes you've come and bridged the gap

No longer searching for you

i'm the light that points to you

Its the same anointing

same anointing

since i was born

and up untill my Jesus comes

I have never seen the Lord changeth
