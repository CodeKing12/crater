JUST PRAISE MASS CHOIR
MINISTERING
WERE YOU THERE

Were you there,
when they crucified my Lord

Were you there,
when they crucified my Lord

Sometimes it causes me to tremble, and tremble

Were you there,
when they crucified my Lord

Were you there,
when he rose

Were you there,
when he rose from the tomb

Sometimes it causes me to tremble, and tremble

Were you there,
when he rose from the tomb

Jesus paid it all,
all to him I owe

Sin has left a crimson stain

He washed, he washed me white as snow

Father how can I say thanks

For all the things that you

So many things so undeserved

He gave and he gives, he's always giving

To prove his love for you and me

I wish I had the voices of a million angels

Yet could not express my gratitude

â€˜

Lord I vow to tell the people,
I owe it all to thee

That
To God...

To God be the glory

For the things he hath done
Great things

He hath done great things

Bless his holy name

He hath done great things

Bless his holy name

Bless the Lord
Oh my soul

And all that is within me

Bless his holy name

His holy,
His holy name

Bless your name!
