Hit me
How y'all doin this evening??
How y'all doin this evening??

Do y'all want that bounce??
Do y'all want that bounce??
Do y'all want that bounce??

That bounce

Everybody wanna be like you
they want power and praise like you but

see there is no God, Like our God
There's no one like you

Who gave their life like you and
Who payed our price like you

See there's only one God, That's our God
There's no one like you

oh oh oh oh...

Verse1
Who can touch like you

Or heal us like you do

We stumble and we stray
still you always let us through

Who makes all things new
And comes to our rescue

Death hell and the grave
They could not conquer you

Pre-chorus
Became just like me
To unlock and set free

This prisoner that was deeply wounded and redeemed
The me I could not see

Chorus
Everybody wanna be like you
they want power and praise like you

but see there is no Go, Like our God
There's no one like you

Who gave their life like you and
Who payed our price like you see

There's only one God, That's our God
There's no one like you

Verse2
Some may worship things
But what joy do they bring

They try and hide mistakes
But can they set us free

See where would we be, without Calvary
A king upon a tree
So the whole world can see
(That you)

You became just like me
To unlock and set free

This prisoner that was deeply wounded and redeemed
The me I could not see

Everybody wanna be like you
they Want more power and praise like you

but see there is no God
Like our God
There's no one like you

Who gave their life like you would
Who payed our price like you payed

There's only one God
That's our God
There's no one like you

Bridge
Healer, father, saviour
Counselor, friend, provider

Was is and forever
that's why I just wanna be where you are

I'll travel life with you ,no matter how far

Hey hey hey hey

(I glad that you)

Became just like me
To unlock and set free

This prisoner that was deeply wounded and redeemed
The me I could not see

Everybody wanna be like you
with More power and praise like you

but see there is no God
Like our God
There's no one like you

Who gave their life like you would
Who payed our price like you payed

There's only one God
That's our God
There's no one like you

There's no one like you
There's no one like you

There's no God like our God
There's no one like you
