SUPER HERO

INTRO
I just wanna be your Super Hero
Would you Let me be your SuperHero..

Super Father...Super God..
My Everlasting..The Greatest one..

That's who you are...

I just wanna be your Super Hero

Everybody's Got something they want...
Everybody's Got some prayer request

But as I sing this Song from my I heart
and sing this song from my Soul..

Everybody wants something from the Lord yeah..
Everybody's Got some prayer request..

But I just Sing this Song to you to let you know that....
I've got a Desire in my Heart to be eh...

When I think of all the things
That you've done in my Life

And grateful and  I  lift my voice to say that

I decide to be God's Superman
I decide to be God's Super Hero
