Jerusalem, I will speak up
for your good.
I will never be silent
till you are safe and secure,
sparkling like a flame.
2 Your great victory will be seen
by every nation and king;
the Lord will even give you
a new name.
3 You will be a glorious crown,
a royal headband,
for the Lord your God.

4 Your name will no longer be
“
but
You will please the Lord;
your country
will be his bride.
5 Your people will take the land,[a]
just as a young man
takes a bride.
The Lord will be pleased
because of you,
just as a husband is pleased
with his bride.

6 Jerusalem, on your walls
I have stationed guards,
whose duty it is
to speak out day and night,
without resting.
They must remind the Lord

7     and not let him rest
till he makes Jerusalem strong
and famous everywhere.

8 The Lord has given his word
and made this promise:
“
to your enemies
the grain and grapes
for which you struggled.

9 As surely as you harvest
your grain and grapes,
you will eat your bread
with thankful hearts,
and you will drink your wine
in my temple.

10 People of Jerusalem,
open your gates!
Repair the road to the city
and clear it of stones;
raise a banner to help
the nations find their way
