You are the God of awesome wonders

I have tasted of your power

Onise Iyanu

You have shown me so much mercy

Much more than I deserve


My eyes have seen, my ears have heard

The wonders of your praise


Creation bows in awe of you

And we join to give you praise


The words you speak turns things around


Your outstreched arms
Has lifted me

You took away the chains and colts that held me bound
