SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

There is power In the name of jesus

To break every chain

Break every chain

There's an army rising up

To break every chain

I hear the chains falling

No mountain's too high

No valley's too low

That can take me away from your Love

When I sing forth my song

It goes unto your name

I will praise you Lord and sing all my days

I sing for you

I dance for you

All I ever want to do is all for you

I move for  you

I live for you

All I ever want to do is all for you

You are my strength and my shield

My guardian and Friend

Unto me O GOD

You are the Ancient of days

You're the reason why I sing

Oh Oh GOD its all for You

PRAISES

For upon us is your glory And your grace

And upon us is your beauty And your love

From glory to glory
You are taking us

You're taking me higher

Higher.......

From glory to glory
