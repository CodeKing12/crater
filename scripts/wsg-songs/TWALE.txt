TWALE

Kabiesi olu orun, I have come to give you twale
(To give you twale)

To give you worship
(To give you worship)


If I was a little child

I will sing and shout for joy


If I was a stallion o

I will use my horse power

If I was a shinning star

I will illuminate everywhere

If I was the son of a governor

I will make everybody throw-way salute o

And if I have all the time

I will praise you over and over

I will give you the worship that only you deserve, yes sir

I will look for beautiful names

like aladewura o


And I will go on soun and patewo iye gborukorega


Kabiesi olu orun, I have come to give you twale
(To give you twale)

To give you worship
(To give you worship)


Only a fool will look into the heavens

and say there is no God

Only a mad man will look into the seas

and tell me that the fishes are a mistake

Even the babalawos can testify

that there's only Jehovah

So who are to tell me that my Yahweh

My tsidkenu doesn't exist

He's a consuming fire o o

Yes He's the lion of the tribe of Judah

Him alone shall I serve o

For the rest of my days


Yahweh Yahweh where would I be

If not for you

That's why I sing

Yahweh Yahweh I worship you

I worship you, I worship you

Baba na you, love gidi kwegu

When I think about the things you do
