And I searched through the scriptures
To know who my God is

I know He is the key to knowledge

He is the offspring of wisdom

He is the door way of deliverance

He is the pathway of peace

He is the road way to righteousness

He is the highway of holiness

He is the gateway of glory

He is the Messiah
He is the convicted
He is the son of God

He is the saviour of my soul
He is the source of my strength

You are the source of my strength
Na you

You are the strength of my life
Na you

You are my hope and my joy

PRAISES:

These are the days of Elijah
Declaring the word of the Lord yeah

And these are the days
Of your servant Moses
Righteousness being restored

These are the days of great trials
Of famine and darkness and sword

Still we are the voice
In the desert crying
Prepare ye the way of the Lord

Behold He comes
Riding on the clouds

Shinning like the sun
At the trumpet

Lift your voice
Year of Jubilee

Out of Zion

And these are the days of Ezekiel
The dry bones becoming flesh

And these are the days
Of your servant David
Rebuilding a temple of praise

And these are the days of the harvest
The fields are all white in Your world

And we are the labourers
That are in Your vineyard
Declaring the word of the Lord

Behold He comes
Riding on the clouds

Shinning like the sun
At the trumpet

Lift your voice
Year of Jubilee

Out of Zion
