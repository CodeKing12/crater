Time and time again

Tried to do it on my own

Thought i belive but all i did was put my trust in my own hands

Tired of running round in cirvles

Ama respond to your word

My faith is built up no longer a shadow of doubt

Cause I'm one

You can make mountains move if you believe

Greater is he who lives in me

He said greater works will we do

Greater is he who lives in me

Speak in the name the name of Jesus

Live in the name

Move in the name
