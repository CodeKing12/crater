CHORUS
On Christ the solid Rock I stand
All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

VERSE 1
My one is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus' name

VERSE 2
My Joy is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus' name

VERSE 3
My praise is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus' name
