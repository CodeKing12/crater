And for faith to
And have earnestly,
But you cannot have
Until all on the altar is

Is your all on the altar

You can only be blest,
And have peace and
As you yield Him your

Would you walk with
In the light of His
And have peace and
You must do His sweet
On the altar your all

Oh, we never can
What the Lord will
Of the blessings for
Till our body and
And our all on the altar

Who can tell all the
He will send from
And how happy our
Of the fellowship sweet
We shall share at His
When our all on the
altar is laid
