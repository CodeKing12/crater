Holy Holy, God Almighty

It's a privilege to worship You

Maker of all universe

It's an honour just to stand before You

With a grateful heart,
I lift my hands to You

Proclaiming Lord, You reign

Great are You, Lord
Greatly to be praised

Greatly to be praised
Father, You reign

Great are You, Lord, Great are You, Lord

With a grateful heart, we lift our hands to You

I love You more and more and more
And more and more and more and more
And more and more

And more everyday, every moment, every hour
Great!

Great is our God
We tell it in all the world

How beautiful He is
Father, You reign
Hallelujah
