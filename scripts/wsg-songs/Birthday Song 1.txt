When I look back at my story

No one else to tell it for me

Tunmibi came and change my story

celebrating his arrival

Now living in his righteousness and by his grace

Lives are changing

Blessing blessings everywhere

Testimonies we getting daily

Our news spread day by day

But in the coming days

They go try to farawe
(Farawe)
