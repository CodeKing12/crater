SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

Jesus,
Your love is great...

Your love is great, in my own life

He has done marvelous things for me

I will praise Him each and everyday

What He's done my mouth can't tell it all

I'll praise Him,
I'll praise Him, I'll praise Him

We give you praise, we give you praise, we give you glory

We give you praise, we give you glory

We give you praise, we give you praise, we give you glory

Halleluyah,
Halleluyah, Amen
