You are Good, you are kind
You are more than these
I'm lost for Words trying to describe you
Elohim, El-elyon, Aleselewi
Your Greatness is all I see
There is nothing you cannot do
There's no mountain you cannot move
If you have said it
Then you will do it
Cause You have a Track record
Of keeping Words
And you're not about
To stop doing it now

Olorun Agbaye oh
(You are Mighty oh)
Olorun Agbaye oh, oh
(You are Mighty oh)
Shebi iwo lo f'oju Orun
(S'aso bora)
Shebi eyin le f'oju Orun
(S'aso bora)
Olorun Agbaye oh,
(You are Mighty oh)
