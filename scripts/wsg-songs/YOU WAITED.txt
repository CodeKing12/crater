MINISTERING
YOU WAITED

VERSE 2
You came out of your way

You sat down to speak to me

What amazing love

Bridge
You've shown
so patiently

You waited for me

Just for me

VERSE
You called out my name

Knew my past covered my shame

This amazing love

VERSE
You've shown
so patiently

You waited for me

Just for me

Oh oh oh

Where would I be?

If you left me God

You waited...
