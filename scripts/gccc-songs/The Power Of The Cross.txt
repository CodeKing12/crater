Verse 1
A lonely hill
A rugged tree
Time stands still and waits for my answer
This sacrifice is calling me to a life
Of total surrender

Chorus 1
The power of the cross is moving in my life
'Cause the power of Your blood has saved me
The power of the cross still draws me to Your side
'Cause the power of Your love has changed me
Oh let my life be lost in the power of the cross

Verse 2
Lord most high
Hope of man
You are my Redeemer and Savior
All my days are in Your hand
All my praise will be Yours forever

BRIDGE
Where mercy was great and grace was free
Where pardon was multiplied to me
Where my burdened soul found liberty
Hide me in the power of the cross
