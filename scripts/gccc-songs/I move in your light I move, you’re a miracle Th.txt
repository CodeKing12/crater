oh oh oh oh oh

ah ah ah ah

Your faith lights my day
I
Right inside of me

There
A knowing of where I
This is my heritage
I

I move in your light
I move, you are my
Eternal life is my miracle.

Out of the darkness
Out of pain came
I
You are my miracle
Out of the pressure
Out of the fire came
I
I
You
