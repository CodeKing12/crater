Verse 1
Before I spoke a word
You were singing over me
You have been so, so
Good to me
Before I took a breath
You breathed Your life in me
You have been so, so
Kind to me

Chorus
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending,
Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm
I couldn't earn it
I don't deserve it
Still You give yourself away
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending,

Verse 2
When I was your foe, still Your love
You have been so, so
Good to me
When I felt no worth
You paid it all for me
You have been so, so
Kind to me

There's no shadow You won't light up
Mountain You won't climb up
Coming after me
There's no wall You won't kick down
Lie You won't tear down
Coming after me

You're coming after me
You're coming after me
You're coming after me
