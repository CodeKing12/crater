Sitting at the edge of death,with seriousness in my service to it.
So devoted, tending my cares in slavery to my ex_boss, with the strength in

I was made the head of all protocol of sinful desires
The next on command to the owner of worldly  practices
Locked up against (life) behind the bars of uncertainty towards the future!

All pictures that leads to greatness  became so blurry to the sight,
The dimness of foolishness was my total course of study
I leaned on myself, that could not save me from myself.
My journey against life was done with total attention even God God could

I was busy exchanging the original  for the counterfeit sorrow seems like a
I felt so fulfilled in the gallows of my worries

Right inside of me I knew I was looking for something
I could not fathom what I was running after.
A big vacuum was in me, so void no one could  profer an answer to my silent

All along i know I was in search of something.
I was blinded  by the news of the uncertain promises that my ex boss had
I was at the virge of giving up when I heard the sound
The sound, that came with a volume nothing else could ever be heard!

In the same sound, I heard the word LIFE in a new way

It came inside my heart, sounding like metal  penetrating my spirit I could

I decided to follow  the voice, I traced it from where was locked; I realized
A front me I saw someone blazing with Genuine  smile, willing to lock me up

The love took me in, dressed me up and gave me a new life and leadership.
Gave me responsibility  for a shoe
Gave me men for a dress
Gave me words for royalty
Look at me now!
My life is wrapped  in the bundle of life.
