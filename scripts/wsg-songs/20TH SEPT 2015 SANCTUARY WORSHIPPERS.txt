SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

Before the throne is where we

To offer praise and seek wisdom

You have turned the veil that separate

No more outside now in your grace

So we bow as we enter the throne room

As we cast ourselves down at your feet

We cry holy, thou art holy

There is non like you

In your presence is where we must be

Prepare our heart for service now

When we fall short please show us how

Guide us with your truth

Ancient of days renew our heart

And bless our ways

So we bow


PRAISE

I am the head and not the tail

I am above and not beneath

Distinguished by his glorious light

To stand out wherever am found

I am a carrier of his glory

To show forth his praises on high

His glory it

God as glorified me

The glory of the lord is risen

Upon me


Glorified me
