MINISTERING
ALL FOR ME

Oh oh oh

If He never ever does another thing

He

more than I could dream

We love You

We give You the praise

He gave His life for me

Just so I could live life totally free

We love You

We give You the glory

All for me

Did it all for me

He left His throne

Came to earth unknown for me

Did it all for me

And He took that walk

Carrying the cross for me

Did it all for me

I

Till the world is lighted by His shine

Lord
You

And everywhere that I go

I

That You are

You are God alone

Did it all for me

He left His throne

Came to earth unknown for me

Did it all for me

And He took that walk

Carrying the cross for me

Did it all for me

Oh oh oh
