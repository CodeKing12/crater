DEFYING GRAVITY

Something has changed within me

Something is not the same

I'm through with playing by the rules of someone else

Too late for second guessing
Too late to go back to sleep

It
Close my eyes and leap

It
I think I

And you can

So if you care to find me
Look to western sky

As someone told me lately
Everyone deserves a chance to fly

And if I'm flying slowly,
At least I'm flying free

To those who ground me,
Take a message back for me

Tell them how I'm defying gravity
I'm flying high defying gravity

And soon I
And will be there and all of us

No wizard that, there is or was, Is ever gonna bring me down

Bring me down...

Uhuhuh uhuhuh
