WORD SANCTUARY MASS CHOIR INT
MINISTERING
BEFORE THE THRONE

Before the throne
Is where we come

To offer praise
And seek wisdom

You have torn the veil
That separates

No more outside
Now in your grace

chorus
So we bow
As we enter the throne room

And we cast ourselves down
At your feet

We cry holy
Thou art holy

There is none like you

In your presence
Is where we must be

verse2
Prepare our hearts
For service now

When we fall short
Please show us how

Guide us with Your truth
Ancient of days

Renew our hearts
And cleanse our ways

chorus
So we bow
As we enter the throne room

And we cast ourselves down
At your feet

We cry holy
Thou art holy

There is none like you

In your presence
Is where we must be
