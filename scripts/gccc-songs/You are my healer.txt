You are my healer
You are my healer
You are my healer
You attend to all my case
You attend to all my matter

There is a balm in Gilead
There is a Physician in the house
Waiting for me
There is a balm in Gilead
A balm in Gilead
Waiting for me

Healer in Zion
Waiting for me
There is a balm in Gilead
I run to your arms
I run to your arms oo

All you who labour
And are heavy laden
Come to the house
There is a balm in gilead
He
He
