I thank thee oh Father

LORD of heaven and the earth

The LORD, The LORD God

merciful and gracious in all your ways

Longsuffering and abundant

in goodness and truth

Keeping mercy for thousands,

forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin

You are good

and your mercy endureth

forever and ever
