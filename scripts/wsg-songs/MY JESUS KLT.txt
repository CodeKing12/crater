verse
As we stand before your presence,

Kings and Priests that's who we are

Your incense burns on the altar

Your spirit leads me on

chorus
My Jesus, my Saviour

You are the one backing me up

cause I live for you

And my life is you

You are my life

You are my strength

You're my everything

Everything is you

You are my backbone

You are my best friend

You are my all...
