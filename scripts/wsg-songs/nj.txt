I've climbed into
the highest mountain

Looked all around

Went down into the deepest valley

Searched all around and

I went across the deep blue sea

Couldn

nobody greater than you

searched all over
couldn

I looked high and low
still couldn

nobody greater
nobody greater than you

nobody can heal
like you can

awesome in all your ways
and mighty is your hand

you are He who
carried out redemption plan

searched all over

I looked high and low
still couldn

nobody greater uh uh

nobody greater than you

nobody greater than you
