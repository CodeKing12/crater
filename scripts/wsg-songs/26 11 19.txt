WORSHIPPERS

VERSE 1
Halleluyah

You have won the victory

Halleluyah

You have won it all for me

Death could not hold you down

You are the risen king

Seated in majesty

You are the risen king

VERSE 2
I surrender all to you

Everything I give to you

Withholding nothing

I give myself away
I give myself away

So you can use me
