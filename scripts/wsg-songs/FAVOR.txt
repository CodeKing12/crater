If you got the favor of God on your life say yeah (yeah)

If you got the favor of God on your life say oh yeah (oh yeah)

I got it (I got it)

Favor favor favor

Oh I got the favor of God on my life

I've never seen the righteous forsaken

Nor his seed begging for bread

The Lord is my light and my salvation

I won't fear I won't be afraid

Favor favor favor

Oh I got the favor of God on my life

F A V O R is on me

Favor

I got it
