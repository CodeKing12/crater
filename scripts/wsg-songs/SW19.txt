PRAISE TEAM

I love to praise Your name
I love to lift You up

We bless Your name
Sweet Jesus

Demons tremble at the name
When I call Him

Mountains move at the sound
When I shout it

Thy name is above all names

Every knee shall bow
And tongue confess Jesus

I love to praise Your name
I love to lift You up

We bless Your name
Sweet Jesus

Sweet Jesus


Praises:

Blessed be Your name
In the land that is plentiful

Where your streams of abundance flow
Blessed be Your name

Blessed be Your name
When I

Though I walk through the wilderness
Blessed be your name

Every blessing you pour out
I

When the darkness closes in Lord
Still I will say

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your name

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your glorious name

Blessed be Your name
When the sun

When the world
Blessed be Your name

Blessed be Your name
On the road marked with suffering

Though there
Blessed be Your name

Every blessing You pour out
I

When the darkness closes in Lord
Still I will say

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your name

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be Your glorious name
