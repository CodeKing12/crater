MINISTERING
I OWE IT ALL

Lord you are so wonderful  to me

Your holiness amazes me

I bow before your majesty

Oh Lord

To you I owe my worship

Holy one,
Righteous son,
lamb of God

One who was slain

I owe all my worship to you

I owe Lord I do deserve

All the things that you do

I owe I owe I owe my worship
