Let it rain

Let it rain

Let it rain

Your glory Lord

Let it rain

Let it rain

Let it rain

Your power Lord

Let it rain

Let it rain

Let it rain

As I strike out in your presence

Let it rain

Let it rain

Let it rain

Oh oh oh oh

Let it rain

Let it rain

Let it rain

I've come to the waters

To be fed by your ravens

I've come to the fire

Consume all the sacrifice

And wash me clean

Oh oh

Shower pour on us

Rivers flow on us

Presence come

We are ready Lord

Overflow us Lord

We need you now

Shower pour on us

Rivers flow on us

Presence come

We are ready Lord

Overflow us Lord

We need you now
