You are Good, you are kind
You are more than these
I'm lost for Words trying to describe you
Elohim, El-elyon, Aleselewi
Your Greatness is all I see
There is nothing you cannot do
There's no mountain you cannot move

If you have said it
Then you will do it
Cause You have a Track record
Of keeping Words
And you're not about
To stop doing it now
