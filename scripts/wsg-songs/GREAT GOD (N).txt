You're so great beyond the Heavens

Yet you choose to live in Purity

Your power is vast beyond the oceans

Yet For Love compressed yourself in man.

Who can compete with your Love

What can equate to your Great will

Great God

Great God

Great God

You never cease to amaze

Such a marvelous gift you gave

You decended and ascend that you might fill all things

Yes you magnified us

That your Life might become ours

And you Glorified us

Now we can live as You

Uh uh uh uh uh

Yes the Great God

In a small man

Released himself in a low estate

That we might live in his fullness

And be called his own.. Eternally...

Great God

Great God

Great God

You never cease to amaze

I'll live to tell of your Great name in all the Earth

I'll fill the Earth with your Glory , I'll never sly away

Great God

Great God

Great God

You never cease to amaze

There is a ranging in the Spirit

There is a changing

The Mighty one is right in here today

And he's causing a change

In everyone right here.

Great God

Great God

Great God

You never cease to amaze
