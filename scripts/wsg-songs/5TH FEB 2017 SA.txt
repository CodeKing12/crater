SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

Holy holy holy,

Lord God Almighty

Early in the morning,

My soul shall rise to Thee

Holy holy holy,

Merciful and mighty

God in three Persons,

Blessed Trinity

All hail the power of Jesus Name

Let angels prostrate fall

Bring forth the royal diadem,
And crown Him Lord of all

And crown Him Lord of all...
