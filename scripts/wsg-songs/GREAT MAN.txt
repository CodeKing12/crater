I was small and just a man

trying to do what's right

Everything looked just so bad

I didn

but God is near and his spirit lives in me

He lives in me

and that means something to me Yeah

God is near and his spirit lives in me

He lives in me

and that means everything to me

When I was hopeless and at my quitting point

Everything looked so bad

There were times I had no hope

and had no strength

I had to fight

but had no strength

so I had to lay low,

I had to lay low

but my God can still do something

if you believe

just believe

there are things that will not come

unless you just believe

just believe

God is here

tap in for your blessings

you are not poor,

thank him for your riches

Sing a song

would you sing a song

God knows when

you are....

A great man

get into your battles

great man

get into your battles

God is your strength

great man

get into your battle

you are....

A great man

just believe
