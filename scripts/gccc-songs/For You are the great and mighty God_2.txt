For You are the great and mighty King
You rule in every nation
On Christ the solid rock,
You are worthy to be praised
You are Alpha and Omega, I worship You today
In You I put my trust, You name I will extol

Heaven speaks of Your glory
And the earth of Your beauty
Your love is new every morning
And Your faithfulness is ever sure

Yelele, Uyingwele (You are Holy),
Yelele, Uyingwele (You are Holy),
Yelele, Uyingwele (You are Holy),
Yelele, Uyingwele (You are Holy),

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
