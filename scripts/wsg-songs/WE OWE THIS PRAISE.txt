MINISTERING
WE OWE THIS PRAISE

Every hand in the room

Should be lifted for what He has done

If we had ten thousand hands

We couldn't raise them enough

And every voice in this place

Should be raised giving God praise

If we had ten thousand hands

We couldn't raise them enough

He had to pay the price to give us life

And now with all that's within

We owe this praise to him

We owe this praise to him

Every hand in the room

Should be lifted for what He has done

If we had ten thousand hands

We couldn't raise them enough

And every voice in this place

Should be raised giving God praise

If we had one million voices

We couldn't raise them enough

He had to pay the price

To give us life

And now with all that's within

We owe this praise to him

We owe this praise to him

Owe it all to Him

Give it all to Him
