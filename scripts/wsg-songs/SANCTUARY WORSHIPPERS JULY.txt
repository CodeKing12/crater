This is the air I breath

Your holy presence living in me

This is my daily bread

You very word spoken to me

And I am
Am desperate for you

And I am
Am lost without you

Holy holy

Are you Lord God Almighty

Worthy is the lamb

Amen

All the glory belong to you

All the glory belong to you oh God

Ha le lu yah

Yahweh

Yahweh be praised

Halleluyah

Yahweh be praise
