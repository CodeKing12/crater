VERSE 5

I say we gods now

We take the world now

We dominating cities because we speak the word now

Shey God's the word na?

And the word is God na?

So when we speak the word then we're gods speaking God na

Now every morning when i wake up God dey make me jubilate

Cause i am sensitive in the spirit i know whats for the day

With the word of God in me oh men I

I get the benefits so I'm bringing life to the states

No be say we too dey brag..na authority

Now when enemies see us they bow..to divinity

And the way we do the things we do they get inquisitive

Cause they no fit understand the way we do this ministry

Ogbeni if you no get life class...you no get high class

Because we've gat high standards Thats why we stand out

And when we start dey lebra kadosh (speak in tongues) we no dey calm down

Because na the spirit dey at work no be man power

Now in every situation my God's got me

Now i'm here to take the nation with God's Army

I'm so much Blessed to mention not just money
