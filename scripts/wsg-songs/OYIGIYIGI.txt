OYIGIYIGI

There's no one like you
No one fit be like  you

No one compare
No one fit do all the things you do

Time to sing praise oh
Sing hallele luyah.. to the most high God

Mimshach is working
Omo na spreading things

Too much anointing
Omo na winning things

Follow me praise am
Follow me praise am global

Follow me praise am
Follow me praise Jehovah

Put on your dancing shoes

Ready to dance in twos

Follow me praise am
Follow me praise am global

Kabiesi oba nla
Oba atererere

Thanks for your word and the spirt
