I depend on You
I depend on You
I depend on You
I depend on You
You have helped me in the past
You will help me again (You will do it again and again)
You have helped me in the past
You will help me again

Oh Jesus, I depend on You
Oh Jesus, I depend on You
You are not a man that You should lie
You speak a word and it is done
Oh Jesus, I depend on You
