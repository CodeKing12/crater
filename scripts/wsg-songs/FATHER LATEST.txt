I will put you in front In front of my melody

You're all that matters You're all that matters

I'll make room for two You and I Jesus

You're all that matters You're all that matters

Owei, Owei You're all that matters

Owei, Owei
You're all that matters

Owei, Owei
You're all that matters to me Jesus

Owei, Owei
You are all that matter

I am your own, I am your own

Till the day you will come

Jesus I am your own
