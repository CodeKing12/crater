This life that I live is all yours

I move and have my being all in you

I'm aligned to your Will

Not mine but yours be done

Jesus as in heaven so on earth

This song that I sing is all yours

Take my heart , take all of me

If you're looking for a man

You're looking for a vessel

I say yes, Amen! I say yes

My song is yes, yes, yes Lord

In your sufficiency yes yes Lord

If you're looking for a man

You're looking for a vessel

I say yes, Amen I say yes

This Air that I breathe is all yours

Consecrated Lord to thee

If you need a man to pray

This hands that I lift is all yours

Take the Glory Father take the praise

If you're looking for just one man

You're looking for a vessel

I say yes Amen I say yes

My song is yes, yes Lord

In your sufficiency yes yes Lord

If you're looking for just one man

Eh ..You're looking for a vessel

I say yes, Amen I say yes

What is life if it's not lived for you, you you you

What is life if I don't shout
