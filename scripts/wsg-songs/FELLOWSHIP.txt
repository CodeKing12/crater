Just dey father me dey go

Constant fellowship with the father and me

I love how you father me

Just dey father me dey go

Many wanna see your acts

Many wanna see your hands

I just wanna know you more

I just wanna be with you

That I may know your ways and not your acts alone

I love how you father me

I no wan break your heart

That I may know your ways and not your acts alone

Just dey father me dey go

I no go break your heart

My daddy my daddy

Your baby is singing

I

for the rest of eternity
