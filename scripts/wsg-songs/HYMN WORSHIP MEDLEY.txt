TAG 1
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,

Let me hide myself in Thee;

Let the water and the blood,

From Thy riven side which flowed,

Be of sin the double cure,

Save me from its guilt and power.


Not the labor of my hands

Can fulfill Thy law

Could my zeal no respite know,

Could my tears forever flow,

All could never sin erase,

Thou must save, and save by grace.


TAG 2
Praise, my soul, the King of heaven;

to his feet your tribute bring.

Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,

evermore his praises sing.

Alleluia, alleluia!

Praise the everlasting King!


Praise him for his grace and favor

to his people in distress.

Praise him, still the same as ever,

slow to chide, and swift to bless.

Alleluia, alleluia!

Praise the everlasting King!


TAG 3
O Jesus, I have promised

to serve Thee to the end;

be Thou forever near me,

my Master and my Friend;

I shall not fear the battle

if Thou art by my side,

nor wander from the pathway

if Thou wilt be my Guide.


O let me feel Thee near me,

the world is ever near;

I see the sights that dazzle,

the tempting sounds I hear;

my foes are ever near me,

around me and within;

but, Jesus, draw Thou nearer,

and shield my soul from sin.


TAG 4
As the deer panteth for the water

So my soul longeth after Thee

You alone are my heart's desire

And I long to worship Thee

You alone are my strength, my shield

To You alone may my spirit yield

You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship Thee


You're my friend
And You are my brother

Even though You are a King

I love You more than any other

So much more than anything

You alone are my strength, my shield

To You alone may my spirit yield

You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship Thee
