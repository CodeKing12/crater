You created the stars

They shine in the

brightness of their glory

You created the sun

So radiant, oh its golden rays

You created the birds

They tune so sweet their sound

You created ME

A perfect reflection of YOU

TAG
Create in me a clean heart

Put a fresh wind in my sails

Help me learn your wisdom

In my inmost heart

You created the skies

They stand so tall without pillars

You created the trees

Yes, in their sizes and shapes

You created the moon

So many more, but a mention of few

You created ME

A perfect reflection of YOU

TAG
Create in me a clean heart

Put a fresh wind in my sails

Help me learn your wisdom

In my inmost heart

TAG
A heart of flesh for your statutes

A circumcised mind

A longing soul for you my King

A never failing heart

A new spirit, so pure and clean

No self willed nor vain

But prevailing every frailty

Tis my prayer Lord..
