Peace, bringing it all to peace
The storm surrounding me
Let it break at Your name

Still, call the sea to still
The rage in me to still
Every wave at Your name

Jesus, Jesus, You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus, You silence fear
Jesus, Jesus, You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus

Breathe, then call these bones to live
Call these lungs to sing
Once again, I will praise

Your name is a light that the shadows can't deny
Your name cannot be overcome
Your name is alive forever lifted high
Your name cannot be overcome

Yours is the Kingdom, Yours is the power
Yours is the glory forever, amen
Yours is the Kingdom, Yours is the power
Yours is the glory forever, amen
