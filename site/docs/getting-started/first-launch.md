# First Launch Setup

After installing Crater, you'll need to configure your projection display. This guide walks you through the initial setup.

## Understanding the Two Windows

Crater uses two separate windows:

1. **Control Window** - This is where you, the operator, work. It stays on your main screen.
2. **Projection Window** - This displays on your projector or secondary screen for the audience.

## Setting Up Your Projection Display

### Step 1: Connect Your Projector or Second Monitor

Before configuring Crater, make sure your projector or second monitor is:

- Physically connected to your computer
- Turned on and displaying a picture
- Set to "Extend" display mode in Windows (not "Duplicate")

**To set Extend mode in Windows:**
1. Press `Windows + P` on your keyboard
2. Select "Extend"

### Step 2: Open Settings

1. In Crater, click the **Settings** icon (gear icon) in the menu bar
2. The Settings dialog will open

### Step 3: Select Your Projection Display

1. In the Settings dialog, find the **Display** section
2. Click the **Select Display** dropdown
3. Choose your projector or secondary monitor from the list
4. The display dimensions will be shown below

### Step 4: Open the Projection Window

1. Click the **projection icon** in the menu bar (it looks like a screen/monitor)
2. The projection window will open on your selected display
3. It should appear on your projector/secondary screen

## Verify Your Setup

To make sure everything is working:

1. Go to the **Scripture** tab in the control window
2. Select any Bible verse
3. Double-click on a verse to send it live
4. Check that the verse appears on your projection display

If you see the verse on your projector, congratulations! You're all set.

## Tips for Projection Setup

- **Keep the control window visible**: Position it where you can easily see it during the service
- **Adjust display resolution**: If text looks fuzzy, check that your projector is set to its native resolution
- **Test before service**: Always arrive early to test the projection before your congregation arrives

## Common Setup Issues

### Projection window appears on wrong screen

1. Go to Settings
2. Change the selected display
3. Close and reopen the projection window

1. Make sure your second display is set to "Extend" mode (not "Duplicate")
2. Check that the correct display is selected in Settings

2. Restart Crater
3. Make sure the display is detected in Windows Display Settings
