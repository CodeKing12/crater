PRAISES

This are the days of Elijah o

Declaring the ways of the LORD

These are the days of His servant o

Moses righteousness been restored

These are the days of great trials o

Of famine and darkness and sword yeye

We are the voice in the desert o crying

Prepare ye the ways of the LORD

Behold He comes o
Riding on the cloud o

Shinning like a sun o
At the trumpet calls o

Lift your voice o
It's year of jubilee

Out of zion's hill salvation comes

Nobody fit be like my GOD o

Nobody pass my GOD o
