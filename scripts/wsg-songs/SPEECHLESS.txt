MINISTERING
SPEECHLESS

VERSE 1
Unending, But always on time

Unfailing, but never unkind

Unmerited, favor is mine

Undeserving, oh but I receive Your

CHORUS
Grace, Lord Your Grace

Oh I need it, I receive it

I'm amazed, so amazed

When I see it, I am speechless

You take my breath away

You take my breath away, whoa
