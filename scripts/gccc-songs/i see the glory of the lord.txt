i see the glory of the lord
I see it rising upon you
i see the glory of the lord
arise and shine

i see the joy of the lord
I see it welling inside you
i see the joy of the lord
arise and shine

i see the power of the lord
I see it welling inside you
i see the power of the lord
arise and shine

i see the victory of the lord
I see it dancing over you
i see the victory of the lord
arise and shine

i see the glory of the lord
arise and shine

dry bones shall live again
dead bones shall rise again
i see a new dawn
i see a new beginning
dry bones shall live again

old wine has gone away
new wine is flowing in

we declare a a new dawn
we declare a new season
dry bones shall live again

i declare a a new dawn
i declare a new season
dry bones shall live again
