You are the reason I live

You are the one for me

Why should I fear when I have you

Surrounded by your love

Your everlasting love

Why should I care what people say

They don't know what you mean to me

VERSE
You and I together forever

Journeying till the end

Journeying till the end

VERSE
When I see Jesus

As I see Jesus

He tells me how to live

He shows me who to be

Everyday and always

With a grateful heart I sing

You have done so much for me

You gave me purpose

You gave me life all for free

With a grateful heart I sing
