THERE IS A KING IN YOU

Verse
You come from royalty

An aristocratic dynasty

The goal of the enemy

Is that you don

There is power when you speak

Be mindful of words you release

I know that life has challenged you

But the king in me speaks to the king in you

You were born to rule

there is a king in you

Bridge
Is there no king in you

Then why do you speak, speak with such low-esteem

I know that life has challenged you

But the king in me speaks to the king in you

You were born to rule there is a king in you

There is a king in you
