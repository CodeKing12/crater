Worthy is Your name, Jesus
You deserve the praise
Worthy is Your name

And now my shame is gone
I stand amazed in Your love undeniable
Your grace goes on and on
And I will sing of Your goodness forevermore

It was my cross You bore
So I could live in the freedom You died for
And now my life is Yours
And I will sing of Your goodness forevermore

Holy is Your name, Jesus
You deserve the praise
Holy is Your name
