MINISTERING
LEAD ON O KING ETERNAL

Lead on, O king eternal

The day of march has come

Henceforth in fields of conquest

Thy tents shall be our home

Through days of preparation

Thy grace has made us strong

And now, O King eternal

We lift our battle song

Lead on, O king eternal

Till sin

And holiness shall whisper

The sweet amen of peace

For nor with swords

Nor roll of stirring drums

With deeds of love and mercy

The heavenly kingdom comes


Lead on, Oh King eternal

We follow, not with fears

For gladness breaks like morning

Where

Thy cross us lifted over us

We journey in its light

The crown awaits the conquest

Lead on, O God of mighty
