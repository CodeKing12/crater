Riding on the colt
Into Jerusalem
Never been seen before
The King of kings is come
All of our finest things
Spread out before the King
The prophets prophesied
Now it

Bring all your broken things
The Master has a need
Never been seen before
The King of kings is come
All of our finest things
Spread out before the King
The prophets prophesied
Now it

Yeh! Hossanna

Ha-lle-luyah Eh!
Ha-lle-luyah Eh!
Ha-lle-luyah Ehhhh!

Ha-lle-luyah
Ha-lle-luyah
Ha-lle-luyah Ehhhh!
