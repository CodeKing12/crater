MINISTERING
SEARCH MY HEART

Search my heart
search my soul

Nothing else
that i want more

Shine your light
show your hands

In my life
Lord have your way

Chorus
With all my love
enjoy my soul

With all i am
Lord i will follow you

VERSE2
Hear my cry
And hear my prayer

Draw me close
I know your hand

Give me strength
And give me grace

You've won me to you
Lord Almighty

Chorus
With all my love
enjoy my soul

With all i am
Lord i will follow you

You took the cross
You took my shame

Restored my life
Now i will to worship you

Without you am nothing
