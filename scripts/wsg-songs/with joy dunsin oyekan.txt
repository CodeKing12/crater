Lift up your heads, oh you gates
And let the King of glory come in

The King is here, no need to fear
In a moment, all sorrows are gone

The King is here, no need to fret
In a moment, all sicknesses are gone

The King is here, no need to fear
In a moment, all sorrows are gone

The King is here, no need to fret
In a moment, all sicknesses are gone

With joy, we draw from the well
With joy, we draw from the well of salvation

With joy, we draw, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, with joy

With joy, we draw from the well
With joy, we draw from the well of salvation

With joy, we draw, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, with joy

The King is here, no need to fear
In a moment, all sorrows are gone

The King is here, no need to fret
In a moment, all sicknesses are gone

The King is here, no need to fear
In a moment, all sorrows are gone

The King is here, no need to fret
In a moment, all sicknesses are gone

With joy, we draw from the well
With joy, we draw from the well of salvation

With joy, we draw, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, with joy

With joy, we draw from the well
With joy, we draw from the well of salvation

With joy, we draw, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, with joy

With joy, we draw from the well
With joy, we draw from the well of salvation

With joy, we draw, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, with joy

With joy, we draw from the well
With joy, we draw from the well of salvation

With joy, we draw, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah, with joy

Joy in the Holy Ghost

Dance in the Holy Ghost

Never lose your joy
Joy is a fetcher

I won't lose my joy

Joy comes in the morning

Joy comes in the morning

It will do me like a dream
