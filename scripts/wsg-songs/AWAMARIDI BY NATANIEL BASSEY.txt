You are the beginning and ending
Alpha and Omega

You seated in the circle of the earth

You are the God who made the universe
Out of void and emptiness

You spoke the word and it fell into place

You're deeper than my mind can grasp and what my eyes can see

Eternity won't be enough to tell of you

As long as I've got breath in me, and through the great beyond

I'll declare the greatness of your name

Awamaridi, awamaridi, ooh
Ohhh!

You are a mystery
Reveal to me your own

So I've come to worship you
I've come to worship you

The heavens of the heavens cannot contain your majesty

And yet you made my heart your dwelling place

I find it hard to understand, the reason for this kind of love

For mortal man who sometimes doesn't care

You took the journey to the cross, and never looking back

You died the sinners' death so I can live again

If this is not the greatest love, I wonder what it is
It can only take a God who is like you! (Jesus)

Awamaridi, (Awamaridi), awamaridi, ooh

You are a mystery, (You are a mystery) reveal to me your own

Awamaridi, (Awamaridi) awamaridi, are you

Awamaridi, (Awamaridi) awamaridi, are you

So I've come to worship you (Awanaridi)

I've come to worship you (Awanaridi)

Cause I live to worship you (Awanaridi)

I live to worship you (Awanaridi) ooh

Awamaridi, Awamaridi, Awamaridi
Ooh ohh ohh oh ohh ohh

Awamaridi, you're a mystery, reveal to me your own
(Speaking in tongues)
