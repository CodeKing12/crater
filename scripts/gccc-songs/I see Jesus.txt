I see Jesus
seated at the right hand of God

I see the king
with the scepter in his hands
I see the king
Ruling over the land

I see the king
with the scepter of righteousness
I see the king
Ruling over the land

Chants

It's your scepter that is ruling over the land
It's your scepter that is ruling over Nigeria
It's your scepter that is ruling over GCCC
It's your scepter (x2)

Oba ta o ri o,
A juba re o
Oba to fimole se asobora
A juba re o
