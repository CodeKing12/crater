If you had not saved me tell me where else would I be

Thank you for your love
Thank you for your grace

If Jesus had not died tell me where else would I be

Thank you for your saving love

When I think about the cross

And the pain you endured for me

I know I am indebted to you

But the only way I see to show I am grateful

Is to take the world and give it back to you

If you had not saved me tell me where else would I be

Thank you for your love
Thank you for your grace

If Jesus had not died tell me where else would I be

Thank you for your saving love

Hallelujah to the lamb that gave his life for me..

Glory honour to the one that sits upon the throne.

If you had not saved me tell me where else would I be

Thank you for your love

Thank you for your grace

If Jesus had not died tell me where else would I be

Thank you for your saving love
