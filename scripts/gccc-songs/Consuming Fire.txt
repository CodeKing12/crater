Chorus 1
And yes our God He is a consuming fire
And the flames burn down deep in my soul
Yes our God He is a consuming fire
He reaches inside and He melts down
This cold heart of stone

Verse 1
Set this place on fire
Send Your Spirit Savior
Rescue from the mire
Show Your servant favor
Well yesterday was a day that I was alone
Now I'm in the presence of Almighty God

BRIDGE
Did you realize that inside of you
There is a flame
Did you ever try to let it burn
Let it burn let it burn
