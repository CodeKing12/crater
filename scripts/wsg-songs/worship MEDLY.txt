Oh lord my God
When I in awesome wonder

Consider all the works thy hands
Hath made

I see the stars
I hear the roaring thunder

Thy power throughtout the universe
Display

Then sings my soul

My savior God to thee

How great thou art


how great thou art

Jesus, Jesus your name is great
You are great, you are great

O lord how excellent

Is your name in all the earth
You set your glory above

The heavens and the earth
When I think of all you made

The sun, the moon, the stars
No praises are enough

To express how great you are


Say lord your are mighty

What a mighty God we serve

Mighty God we serve

Angels bow before the mighty

God we serve

We give you all the glory
We worship you our God

You are worthy to be praised

SONG VOCAL: BY MAKINDE

-

I lay it all the cross
My life belongs to you

And all I would ever become

Cos you are all I want
You are all I want

You are all I sacrifice everything
I have for

How can I love you more
See you more, feel you more

And known you more

You are my magnificent obsession
Object of my desire and lord divine

Cos you are all I want

You are I need
You are all I sacrifice everything

I have for

My life is not my own

To you I belong
I give myself to you

I give myself away
So you can use me.
