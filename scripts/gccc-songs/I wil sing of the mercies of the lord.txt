I will sing of the mercies
With my mouth shall I
From the rising of the sun
Right unto its going down
I will sing of the mercies

I will sing of the mercies

I will shout of the mercies

With my mouth shall I

From the rising of the sun
Right unto its going down
I will sing of the mercies

With my mouth shall I
From the rising of the sun
Right unto its going down
I will sing of the mercies
of the Lord
