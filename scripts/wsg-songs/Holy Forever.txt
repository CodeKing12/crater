A thousand generations

Falling down in worship

To sing the song of ages

To the Lamb

And all who've gone before us

And all who will believe

Will sing the song of ages

To the Lamb

Your name is the highest

Your name is the greatest

Your name stands above them all

All thrones and dominions

All powers and positions

Your name stands above them all

And the angels cry, Holy

All creation cries, Holy

You are lifted high, Holy

Holy forever

If you've been forgiven

And if you've been redeemed

Sing the song forever

To the Lamb

If you walk in freedom

And if you bear His name

Sing the song forever

To the Lamb

We'll sing the song forever

And amen

And the angels cry, Holy

All creation cries, Holy

You are lifted high, Holy

Holy forever

Hear your people sing, Holy

To the King of Kings, Holy

You will always be, Holy

Holy forever
