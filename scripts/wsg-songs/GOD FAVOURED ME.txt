MINISTERING
GOD FAVOURED ME

VERSE

Love is patient
Caring

Love is kind

Love is felt most
when It's genuine

But I've had my share of love abused

Manipulated and it's strength misused

And I can't help but give you glory

When I think about my story

And I know you favoured me

Because my enemies did try but couldn't triumph over me

Yes they did try but couldn't triumph over me

CHORUS

They whispered
Conspired
They told their lies
(God favoured me)

My character
My integrity
I'm one with God
(He favoured me)

Cannot fall
Cannot bend
Can't compromise
(God favoured me)

I speak life
and prosperity
and I speak health
(God favoured me)

BRIDGE

Say Yes (Yes), Yes (Yes), Yes (Yes)
(God favoured me)

BRIDGE  2

I've got favour with me all the time

And I want you to know so do you
(God favoured me)

In the morning
in the noon
in the night time
We got it
(God favoured me)

So speak life
Speak prosperity
and speak health

Oh yeah yeah
(God favoured me)

Touch your neighbour
Tell the person next to you

Tell him I got it,
Tell him we got it

Say Yes (Yes), Yes (Yes), Yes (Yes)
(God favored me)

Wondering why I did not die

I'll be happy to tell you why
(God favoured me)

No longer do I cry when fake friends say goodbye
(God favoured me)

My well is never dry

Cause  I have the well of life
(God favoured me)

Evil tried to bring me down to size

But God said again I'll rise

Say Yes (Yes), Yes (Yes), Yes (Yes)
(God favored me)
