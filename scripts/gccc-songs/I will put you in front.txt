I will put you in front
In front of my melody
You're all that matters
You're all that matters
I'll make room for two
You and I Jesus
You're all that matters
You're all that matters

I'll make room for you
You alone Jesus
You're all that matters
You're all that matters

Owei, Owei
You're all that matters
Owei, Owei
You're all that matters

What would I live for
If I no get you for my
What would I gain
If you take the Holy
What would have
If to say you no hold

What would have been
If to say I no see your
Now I've come to
That you are all I have
You're all that matters
You're all that matters
to me
