MINISTERING
BETTER

When I'm low and feeling down and out, get discouraged

Overtaken by the weight of all the things i've carried

It seems

The only faithful thing is (Me)

I feel alone in the (Struggle)

My life is flooded by all the (Pain)

I'm burdened down by all the (Trouble)

Then i realise I still have you

You make all things better

Being with you make all things better

When the darkness closes in and I can't see daylight

And i'm confused and I don't know what to do with my life

It seems

The only faithful thing is (Me)

I feel alone in the (Struggle)

My life is flooded by all the (Pain)

I'm burdened down by all the (Trouble)

Then i realise i still have you

You make all things better

Being with you make all things better

I know i'm success, but I'm getting better

Still may have some left, but you make it better

I  know i am healed, look to Jesus

As long as i keep on serving, you make it better

My past is behind me, I'm moving ahead

i know that it will be easy, coz you make it better

You make all things better

Being with you make all things better

Better Better Better Better

You make it

You make it better

With you it's

With you it's better

Everything's

Everything's better

Repeat (Better)
