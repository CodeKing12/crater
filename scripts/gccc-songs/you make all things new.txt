open heavens

you make all things new
when you walk into the room

would you walk into the room
would you walk into the room

bring Your colours in my life
Wipe away the dullness
bring your colours in my life

Ooh, bring Your colours in my life
Wipe away the dullness
bring your colours in my life

Ooh, bring Your color in my life
Wipe away the dullness
Bring Your color in my life, Your
Yeah, bring Your color in my life
Bring Your color in my life

It is a new dawn
