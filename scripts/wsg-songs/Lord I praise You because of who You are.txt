You spoke the words and all the worlds came into order

You waved your hands and planets filled the empty skies

You placed the woman and the man inside the garden

And though they fell they found compassion in your eyes

Oh Lord I stand amazed at the wonder of your deeds

And yet a greater wonder brings me to my knees

Lord I praise you, because of who you are

Not just for all the mighty things that you have done

Lord, I worship you, because of who you are

You're all the reason that I need to voice my praise

Because of who you are

One holy night you brought Your promise from a virgin

And promise grew as he revealed to us your heart

Enduring love displayed throughout his Crucifixion

And in the dark, you tore the grave and death apart

Oh Lord I stand amazed at the wonder of your deeds

And yet a greater wonder brings me to my knees

Lord I praise you, because of who you are

Not just for all the mighty things that you have done

Lord, I worship you, because of who you are

You're all the reason that I need to voice my praise

Because of who you are

Because of your amazing grace

Because I see you face to face

Because you're right here in this place

Because you died on Calvary

Because you gave your life for me

Because of you I am set free

Because of who you are

Lord I praise you, because of who you are

Not just for all the mighty things that you have done

Lord, I worship you, because of who you are

You're all the reason that I need to voice my praise

Because of who you are

Because of your amazing grace

Because I see you face to face

Because of who you are
