Jesus oh jesus

Jesus oh jesus

Jesus oh Jesus

Jesus oh Jesus

Your presence makes me whole

As we gather in his name

He said he'll be with us

When he's here

When he's here

When he's here

His presence we feel

Oh the lame the weak the blind

It's been from years of pain

When he's here

When he's here

When he's here

In his presence

You will be blessed

You will be blessed

You will be healed

Jesus oh Jesus

Jesus oh Jesus

Jesus oh Jesus

Your presence makes me whole

Jesus oh Jesus

Jesus oh Jesus

Jesus oh Jesus

Jesus oh Jesus

Your presence makes me whole

Your presence makes me whole

Your presence makes me whole
