When I call the name, Of Jesus
I hear the blood crying out

He who holds the name, As the blood
And He speaks better things for me

So I call Jesus, And I see the blood working

I call Jesus, And His blood that speaks for me

When I call the name, Of Jesus
I hear the blood crying out


He who holds the name, As the blood
And He speaks better things for me


So I call Jesus, And I see the blood working


I call Jesus, And His blood that speaks for me



The blood and the name agree
Jesus and His blood for me



The blood said No,
Satan be gone


Pass over, Pass over


Wonder working power

It's in the blood


Demon chasing power

Poverty killing power


It's in the blood


Bashiga (No)






When I call the name, Of Jesus
I hear the blood crying out

He who holds the name, As the blood
And He speaks better things for me

So I call Jesus, And I see the blood working

I call Jesus, And His blood that speaks for me
