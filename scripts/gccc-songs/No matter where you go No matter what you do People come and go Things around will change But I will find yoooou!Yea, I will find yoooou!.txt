No matter where you go
No matter what you do
People come and go
Things around will change
But I will find yoooou!
Yea, I will find yoooou!

I remember when we were young
How we use to play hide and seek
At the backyard of grandma house
When it
We made memories under the blues sky
Years has gone by but it still feels
Brand new.
