You
Love is a command

That Christians are called to do
Our Lord says

And love your neighbor too

This is a family of God
So our love is spontaneous

Our love is contagious
And our grace, multiplied

You are Word Sanctuary
I am Word Sanctuary

We are Word Sanctuary
And we take the world

What valentine can I give him?

What can I give to Jesus
On this special Valentine

How can I tell him I love him?
And follow him forever?

How can I show I need him?
Should I send a red hat with lace?

Or I run the race with grace?
And follow him forever.

What valentine can I give him?
My impact, my influence or seed?

I
SOULS!!

And follow him forever.

Love from Jesus
This Christian valentine

Sends you love I got from Jesus
Love I learned from the gospels

Found in his word, his actions, and his examples.

This Christian valentine saying
Conveys love I didn

I was saved, couldn
Or understand before I received

The life of Christ and till this life and love is shared abroad.
Happy Valentine

Twice as sweet.

On Valentine
We express our deep affections

Those who are important to us
Get cards and sweet confections

But Christian love is not just for the one we hold most dear
Jesus said to love everyone

He made that very clear.

For us born of the spirit, it is everyday
We should care and love and serve

Every one we meet
Whether they do or don

Yes we know what to do
Is to love, love and keep on loving

Cause Valentine
This makes life twice as sweet.
