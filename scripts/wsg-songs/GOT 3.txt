SPOKEN WORDS

I grew up without knowing who my parents were

At a little age, I was exposed to face so
many temptations most  of which I fell for

I remember those days when I would sneak
into my room, sit by the laptop and visualize

all my illicit imaginations and my hands became
an instrument of the defilement of His temple.

I thought joining them would make me a man,
I really wanted to grow up, so I focused on

the man on the outside and forgot the man on
the inside, I grew old but I never grew up.

That night!  That night!  We robbed them, took
all they had and then I was told to prove my

manhood by shooting the man and his wife, I shot them.

That same night! We we're rounded up by the police,
every single member of the gang was killed,

I thought I had escaped, cus I was running and running,
until I felt the bullet hit my waist and I became paralyzed.

As if that was not enough, two weeks later, I discovered
that the couple I killed, the same ones I shot were my parents

The guilt, I am in total oppression, paralyzed by depression,
my life is a waste....
I am doomed!

But then I met Christ, the power in His name broke the chain,
his love and mercy took away my shame,

he changed my name and
gave me a new name

The yoke of the past is broken, a new me he has awoken,
He gave me the grace, to face the race,

from the place of disgrace into the display of his grace.

When my life began to shatter and crumble, he picked up
the pieces nd fixed the puzzle, made me stable, blessed
me in double, now when the enemies see me they tremble.

I know I sinned against man I killed, I offended God, I sinned,
but then I have been arrested, arrested by Jesus and if my sins

are as high as the mount Everest, they still wouldn't be as high
as me, cus I stand on the Solid ground, protected by his majesty.

If Christ could find me and save me
Then He can save you too
