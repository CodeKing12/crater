MINISTERING
OUR GOD

Water You turned into wine

Opened the eyes of the blind

There's no one like You

None like You

Into the darkness You shine

Out of the glory we rise

There's no one like You

None like You

Our God is greater

Our God is stronger

God, You are higher than any other

Our God is healer

Awesome in power

Our God, our God

Into the darkness You shine

Out of the glory we rise

There's no one like You

None like You, none like You

Our God is greater

Our God is stronger

God, You are higher than any other

Our God is healer

Awesome in power

Our God, our God

Our God is healer
Awesome in power

Our God, our God

Ooh, ooh, ooh

And if our God is for us

Then who can ever stop us

And if our God is with us

Then what can stand against us

And if our God is for us

Then who can ever stop us

And if our God is with us

Then what can stand against

Eh, eh

Then what can stand against

Eh, eh

Then what can stand against

Eh, eh....

Our God is greater

Our God is stronger

God, You are higher than any other

Our God is healer

Awesome in power

Our God, our God...
