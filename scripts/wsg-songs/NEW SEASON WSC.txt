NEW SEASON

It's my season of new
Everything is new for me

The life I now live is fully Christ
Who I am now is not who I was

My identity is only Christ
I'm a new being oh yes I am

It's my season of new
Everything is new for me

It's my season of new
Everything is new for me

So I praise you Lord
For the newness around me

Everywhere I go
I see newness around me

I'm the image of who God is
His very presence I'm clothed with

I am seated in the heavenlies
I am God now oh yes I am

It's my season of new
Everything is new for me

It's my season of new
Everything is new for me

So I praise you Lord
For the newness around me

Everywhere I go
I see newness around me

It's a new season

For me, for me

It's a new level

For me, for me

It's my season of new everything is new for me

It's my season of new everything is new for me

So I praise you Lord for the newness around me

Everywhere I go I see newness around me

It's my season of new
Everything is new for me

It's my season of new
Everything is new for me

So I praise you Lord
For the newness around me

Everywhere I go
I see newness around me.
