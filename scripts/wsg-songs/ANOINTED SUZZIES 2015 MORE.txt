Oh the worshipper in me wants to be
free

From the cares of life that seems to
weigh me down

Oh the worshipper in me needs
consistency

To lift my hands and give you praise

When no one is around

Oh the worshipper in me wants to break
free

From this intellectual mentality

Like when I should be up I
my seat

I should be lifting my hands

Giving you praise and glory

I wanna give my best to you

I wanna do what you ask me to

I wanna go wherever you say

Say the Word and I will obey

I wanna live a life that

I wanna serve you Lord for real

For you deserve all this and more

I give you more

More

I wanna give my best to you

I wanna do what you ask me to

I wanna go wherever you say

Say the Word and I will obey

I wanna live a life that

I wanna serve you Lord for real

For you deserve all this and more

I give you more

More

You deserving of more

You deserving of me

I give you more

I surrender all

I surrender all

All to thee my blessed savior

I surrender all
