Mount Zion

The city of the living God

The heavenly Jerusalem

A dwelling of innumerable company of angels.

The General Assembly and the church of the first begotten

Which are written in Heaven!

And to God, the judge of all and to the spirit of just men made perfect!

It is written in the books that

When you gather for worship

Each one of you is prepared with something

that will be useful for all

Sing a hymn...teach a lesson

tell a story...lead a prayer...provide an insight.

What  worship have you come with

Can you worship without a song?

Worship is not a compilation of songs

Worship is not gyration or hype

Worship is not the progression of chords

Because whatever captures the mind's attention

And your soul's ambition essentially has your worship

Worship is an allegiance to a spirit

Worship is a continuous relationship

Worship is a declaration of God's love

Worship is Communion with a source

The idea of worship is to create Oneness and intimacy

And that through that sound you will get to a height in the spirit

So that God becomes real to you

The Holy Book says

present your bodies a living sacrifice

holy and acceptable unto God which is your reasonable worship

In the city of the living God

Offering holy bodies and lifting of hands is worship.

And that's why I lift my hands and sing...

Chrous
My beloved...is the most beautiful

amongst thousands

amongst thousands

Yeshua ah ah ah ah

Ah ah ah ah ah ah

Yeshua ah ah ah ah

Ah ah ah ah ah ah

My beloved is the most beautiful

amongst thousands

amongst thousands
