There is nothing you can not change

There is nothing you can not do

CHORUS
I believe your word is true

I believe your word is good

I believe your word is true

There is nothing you can not change Jesus

There is nothing you can not do

There is nothing you can not change saviour

There is nothing you can not do

I believe your word is true

I believe your word is good

I believe your word is true

What you say you will do

You will do and never fail

CHORUS
I believe your word is true

I believe your word is good

I believe your word is true

Doesn't matter what people say

Doesn't matter what comes my way

Doesn't matter all what I face

Doesn't matter what people say

I believe your word is true

I believe your word is good

I believe your word is true

I believe your word is true

I believe your word is good

I believe your word is true

What you say will come to through

for your word is my breakthrough

Doesn't matter what have been through

I believe your word is true
