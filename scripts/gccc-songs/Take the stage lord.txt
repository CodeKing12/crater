Take the stage lord
And have your way
I'm just a vessel
And nothing more
And when you're done
Please take the glory
I'm satisfied just to see

Take the stage lord
And have your way
I'm your vessel lord
And nothing more
And when you're done
Please take the glory
I'm satisfied just to see

Oooh dear lord
I ask you to take you
Sing through me
Speak through me
Blow through me
And preach through
That your name be
Let the name of Jesus
Alone be lifted high
Amen amen

Speaking in tongues
And when you're done
Please take your glory
I'm satisfied just to see
That's all I want
I'm satisfied to see

I'm satisfied just to see
you glorified
