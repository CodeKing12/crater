MINISTERING
LORD YOU ARE GOOD

Lord you are good

You've been so good

Lord you are good

You've been been better than good

I can't praise you enough

I owe you my life

Can't praise you enough even if I try cause

You've been so good...

You've been so good to me

So many doors you've opened

So many ways you've made

So many time you've blessed me

You've better than good to me...
