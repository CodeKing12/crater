whenever i come to your presence, your glory comes
and when i see your face the clouds appear

everything freezes(3x)
till it's only you

Anxiety freezes
all my fear freezes
all my doubt freezes
all my shame freezes
till it's only you

all my fear freezes

all my doubt freezes

all my shame freezes

all my guilt freezes

till it's only you

only you

Anxiety freezes

till it's only you (x3)
till it's only you

you alone

no more shame

no more fear

no more guilt
