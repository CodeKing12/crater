Before I spoke a word You were singing over me

You have been so, so good to me

Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me

You have been so, so kind to me

Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God

Oh, it chases me down, fights

And I couldn

Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God

When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me

You have been so, so good to me

When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me

You have been so, so kind to me

Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God

Oh, it chases me down, fights

And I couldn

Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God

There

Mountain You won

There

Lie You won

There

Mountain You won

There

Lie You won

There

Mountain You won

There

Lie You won

Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God

Oh, it chases me down, fights

And I couldn

Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
