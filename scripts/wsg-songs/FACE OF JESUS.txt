Oh you look so good!

Oh yes I do...

What is your secret

Ah Ah! My Secret! It's all in a MIRROR

Wow!  Is it a Magical Mirror?

Oh, I'll like to have one too please...

a magic mirror with a God Mother in it...

Do you have a star magic staff too?  Do you Please?

No! No!  That's not it!

The Mirror I meant is a different one...

It's not Magic Made... God Made it!

Wow!  Really!  God Made It?

That's great...So tell me,

What is the Factor of beauty In that Mirror?

Good question friend!

In this Mirror, there is a Face!

The Face of Jesus!

And the condition is that

you must always remember to look into it at all times...

When you do,  you'll keep looking glorious!

Wow! Really... So what if I stop looking at it?

Then you'll be like that girl over there

Ugh!  She looks so ugly! What's wrong with her

oh no not again,

how can I forget when I just beheld a while ago

(you are so ugly,  you will never be better than this Hahahahha)

(Crying) What do I even look like,

I was beautiful a while ago,  why am I ugly again?

See,  the problem is not the mirror or the voice,

she is,  her focus is on the voice and not what she sees in the mirror.

She is beholding but not face to face

and that is why she could not change into the same glory.

But how can I behold face to face

you cannot know God in the flesh,

for deep calleth unto deep,

and if you don't know the word of God you can not know God,

the word of God is God

is seeing Jesus for people like me Kai?

why not,  the death of Jesus is for the world,

no matter your tribe or language,

the blood of Jesus is our unification,

once you plug into the finished work of Christ,  seeing Jesus is for you.

is it not impossible to see God?

No it is not, when you see Jesus everything is easy,

you glow and you are changed into the same glory,

I have seen Jesus face to face,

no more veils or limitations

all you need to do is to look and you will live......

The face of JESUS!!!!
