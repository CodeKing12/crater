Hey you
Do you know who you are?

You know a lot of people have so many things to say
You know a lot of people have said so many things about you

They said you are too tall, too short, too dark, too fair
One question I have you folk, who are you?

I am more than what people say
I am more than what people see

I am more than what science says
I am blessed, I am great

They might have a number of things to say about you
But have you asked yourself who am I?

For me I Know who I am
Its not new to me at all that I am God

It can be news to them cause they ll have to know
Who do you know that you are

I am more than what people say
I am more than what people see

I am more than what science says
I am blessed, I am great

The best people will have to say about you, the peak of it all is vanity
The best science describes you is an animal...an higher Animal

You see

You might have a lot of things to say about me
You might have a few things to say about me

But God has said

We are  a chosen generation
We are a royal priesthood

We are a holy nation
We are peculiar people

We are God

I am more than what people say
I am more than what people see

I am more than what science says
I am blessed, I am great
