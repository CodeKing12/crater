If I had a moment, to testify

To tell about his goodness and to tell You why

Why I serve a Savior, why I lift Him high

Why I serve my Jesus let me tell You Why

He's been so good to me

He's been so good

So mmm mmm good

He's made a way for me, yes He has brought me out

He's opened doors for me, that's why I gotta shout

He's been so good to me
