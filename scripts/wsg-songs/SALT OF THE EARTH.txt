I carry the flavour of God

I season the earth

I am rich, I am prosperous, I am blessed

I am rich, I am prosperous, I am blessed

I

I  live to dominate

To dominate to dominate

Surely there is no enchantment against me

No divination against me

I am covered

I

highly favoured

In Jesus name

Lift Jesus higher
