Verse 1
Alas, and did my Savior bleed
And did my Sovereign die?
Would He devote that sacred
For such a worm as I.

Verse 2
Was it for crimes that I have
He suffered on the tree?
Amazing pity, grace unknown,
And love beyond degree!

Verse 3
Well might the sun in
And shut His glories in;
When Christ the mighty
For man, the creature's sin.

Verse 4
Thus might I hide my
While His dear cross appears;
Dissolve my heart in
And melt mine eyes to tears.

Verse 5
But drops of grief can ne'er
The debt of love I owe;
Here, Lord, I give myself away,
'Tis all that I can do.
