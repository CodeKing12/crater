MINISTERING
GLORIOUS IMPOSSIBLE

See the Virgin is delivered

In a cold and crowded stall

Mirror of the Father's glory

Lies beside her in the straw

He is Mercy's incarnation

Marvel at this miracle

For the Virgin gently holds

The Glorious Impossible

Love has come to walk on water

Turn the water into wine

Touch the leper, bless the children

Love both human and divine

Praise the wisdom of the Father

Who has spoken through His Son

Speaking still, He calls us to

The Glorious Impossible

Hallelujah

Hallelujah

Hallelujah

Glorious Impossible

He was bruised for our transgressions


And He bears eternal scars

He was raised for our salvation

And His righteousness is ours

Praise, oh praise Him, praise the glory

Of this lavish grace so full

Lift your souls now and receive the

Glorious Impossible!

Hallelujah

Praise, oh praise Him, praise the glory

Of this lavish grace so full

Lift your souls now and receive

The Glorious Impossible

Glory, Hallelujah

Glory, Hallelujah

Glory, Hallelujah

Glory, Hallelujah
