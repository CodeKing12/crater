I will never be caught
Not praising my King
I will never be caught
Not praising my King
It was not me you saw
Not praising Yahweh
It was not me you saw
Not praising my King

Let the praises ring
Give everything to the king of kings
Let the praises ring
Give everything to the king of king

My praise is everyday
Everyday everyday
My praise is everyday
Everyday eh eh, everyday
My praise is everyday
Everyday everyday
My praise is everyday
Everyday eh eh, everyday

Tininininini tanana tinini tanana Tinini tanana
Tininininini tanana tinini tanana Tinini tanana

My praise is everyday
Everyday eh eh, everyday

There'll be no holiday
Cos everyday is my praising day
