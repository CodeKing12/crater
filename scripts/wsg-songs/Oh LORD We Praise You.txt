WORD SANCTUARY CHOIR
MINISTERING
Oh LORD We Praise You


Chorus

Oh Lord we praise You
Oh lord we praise You


VERSE1

I was thinking the other day about the joy that came my way

He took away my frown and those things that held me bound

I thought about all those times when I was walking around in a daze

But today I stand before you with nothing but praise


Chorus

Oluwa ayin o

Odious Ti Alabamus
