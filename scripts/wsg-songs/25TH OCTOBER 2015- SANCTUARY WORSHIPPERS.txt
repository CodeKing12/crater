PRAISE

I just wanna tell you what I think about You

You are the first, the last, beginning and the end

In You I live and move and have my being

You hold my life, my world, my future all in Your hands

And You knew my name before time began

There's absolutely nothing You can't do

Absolutely nothing compares to You

I just want to be more like You

I surrender all, make me more like You

You make all things new, Your love pure and true

Nothing else will do, I'm in love with You

You are everything, everything is You

You are everything (You are everything)...

You are everything

Everything is You

Aterere Kari aye
