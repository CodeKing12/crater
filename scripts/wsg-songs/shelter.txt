From the dawning of the world, And it's wonders

Before the mountains, Reached the skies

From everlasting, To everlasting

You were there through all of time.

All my fathers heard your call

Through the ages, They made the choice to follow you

You were faithful, To the faithful

They found your promise to be true.

You have been a shelter Lord

To every generation, To every generation

A sanctuary from the storm

To every generation, To every generation Lord.

I was born into your arms, Oh my father

There's still a refuge there for me. From my first breath

Drawn from your breath, You've been my security.

You have been a shelter Lord

To every generation, To every generation

A sanctuary from the storm

To every generation, To every generation Lord.

My years go by, Before your eyes

My days rush into the night, Time would steal

Every dream I feel, Give my hopes a place to hide

All the days of my life. Let my children know

Your mercies in the morning, And find your greatness as they grow.

May your glory be their glory. May your heart become their own.

You will be a shelter Lord

To every generation, To every generation

A sanctuary from the storm (Lord you will be)

To every generation, To every generation

You will be a shelter Lord, (Now and forever)

To every generation, To every generation

A sanctuary from the storm (Now and forever)

To every generation, To every generation Lord.
