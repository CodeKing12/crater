SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

I don't wanna sing the latest song

I don't want to percolate the crowd

I just wanna make you smile

I don't care who thinks I' m right or wrong

I don't care who tries to calm me down

I just wanna praise you now

You covered me in the midst of it all

You loved me, gave me another chance

You saw my needs when others saw my faults

You forgave me

I don't have to listen for my name

They don't have to walk me down the aisle

I just wanna make you proud

Should I make the hall of fame

Or they save a special seat

I just hope that you

You covered me in the midst of it all

You love me, gave me another chance

You rescued me

I was going to fall , going to fall

You saved me

{So in my life}

In my life

Be glorified (yeah

CHORUS
You get the glory

You get the praise

You take the honor

I just want to say . . . .

Thank you...

I 've come back to say

Thank you

Thank you Lord

Thank you
(For everything you've done)
