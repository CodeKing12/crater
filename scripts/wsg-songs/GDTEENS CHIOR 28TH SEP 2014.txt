MINISTERING
YOU ARE EVERYTHING

verse1
I just wanna tell you what i think about you
Yeah jesus

You are the first, the last, beginning and the end

In you i live and move and have my being

You own my life my world my future
All in your hands

And you knew my name before time begin

There

And absolutely nothing compares to you

Chorus
i just want to be
More like you

I surrender all make me more like you

You make all things new

Your love pure and true

Nothing else will do

I

You are everything

Everything is you

Oh oh oh.......
