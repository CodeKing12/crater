I wanna be true

Everyday i wanna be more in love with you

I'm gonna work with character

And live with integrity too

Lord, I never want to disappoint you

Jesus, My love for you is true

If you need someone to serve you

Lord, I will

If you need someone to praise you

Oh lord, I will

If you need me to say a word for you

I will, I will

I wanna be true to you

If this world never applauds my name

If this world never rewards me with a Star on the walk of fame

And if i never get the credit for all the good i do

I'll still keep working

I'll still be true to you

I wanna be true

Everyday i wanna be more in love with you

I'm gonna work with character

And live with integrity too

Oh how my love for you is true

From the depths of my soul i love you

I place no one above you
