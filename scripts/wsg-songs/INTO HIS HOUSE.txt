INTO HIS HOUSE

We have come into this house

And gathered in His name
To worship Him

We have come into this house
And gathered in His name

To worship Christ the Lord

So forget about yourself

And concentrate on Him
And worship Him

So forget about yourself

And concentrate on Him
And worship Christ the Lord

Worship Him Christ the Lord
