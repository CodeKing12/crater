1 O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder,

Consider all the worlds thy hands have made;

I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,

Thy power throughout the universe displayed:

Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to thee:
How great thou art! How great thou art!

Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to thee:
How great thou art! How great thou art!

2 When through the woods and forest glades I wander

And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees,

When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur,

And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze

3 And when I think how God, his Son not sparing,

Sent him to die, I scarce can take it in;

That on the cross, my burdens gladly bearing,

He bled and died to take away my sin

4 When Christ shall come with shouts of acclamation,

To take me home, what joy will fill my heart!

Then I will bow in humble adoration,

And there proclaim, my God, how great thou art!
