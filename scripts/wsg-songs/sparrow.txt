Why should I feel discouraged,
Why should the shadows come,
Why should my heart be lonely,
And long for heav
When Jesus is my portion?
My constant friend is He:

His eye is on the sparrow,
and I know He watches me;
His eye is on the sparrow
and I know He watches me.

CHORUS
I sing because I
I sing because I

For His eye is on the sparrow
and I know He watches me

â€œ
His tender word I hear,
And resting on His goodness,

I loose my doubts and fears;

Though by the path He leadeth,

But one step I may see;
His eye is on the sparrow

and I know He watches me;

His eye is on the sparrow
and I know He watches me.

Whenever I get tempted, whenever cloud arise,

When songs give place to sighing,

When hope within we dies,
I draw closer to Him;

From care He sets me free;

His eye is on the sparrow
and I know He watches me;

His eye is on the sparrow
and I know He watches me.
