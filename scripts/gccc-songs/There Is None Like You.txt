Verse 1
You're giver of salvation
Ruler of the nations
Father of creation
I sing to You
My refuge and my strength
Purpose and my peace
The reason I believe when I can't see
Redeemer full of grace
Author of my faith I sing

Chorus 1
There is none like You
We love and we praise
Amazing is Your grace
There is none like You
The only King of kings
Lord of everything
It's true
There is none like You

Verse 2
A few more pages turned
Another lesson learned
'Cause You speak through Your word
Right to my heart
You hold the hands of time
Yet You still hold mine
And I cannot see why You love me like You do
Creator of life
My hope and my guide I sing

Misc 1
BRIDGE
You hold tomorrow
Making all things new
There is none like You
