Blessed is He

Who is sitted on the throne

Blessed is He

He who reigns over the earth

We exalt the name of the Lord

Most High King

Yes we worship at His feet

In His gates

With Thanksgiving in our Hearts

In his court

We will let His praises ring

We exalt the name of the Lord

Most High King

Yes we worship at His feet

Blessed is He

Who is sitted on the throne (blessed is he)

Blessed is He

He who reigns over the earth (blessed is he)
