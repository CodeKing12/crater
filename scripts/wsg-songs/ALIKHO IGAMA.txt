Inhalanhl'engaka

Yokwazana nawe

Ucabanga ngami imihla yonke
(you always think of me always )

Amandla ngawakho
(All power is yours)

Nobukhosi ingobakho
(sovereignty belongs to you)

Konke kungokwakho

Wenza ngaphezu kwemicabango yethu

Akheko ofana nawe
(No one like you)

Alikho Igama elimnandi..

Igama lenkosi liyiyo inqaba
(the name of the Lord is a strong hold)

Ophephela khona uyakusindiswa
(those who run into it will be saved)

Ohlezi kuyona akanakwesaba
(those  who dwell in the name have no fear)

Nokuba umhlaba uzanyazanyiswa

Alikho Igama elimnandi..
(No name as sweet as your name)

Igama lakho...
(your name)

Ungcwele ungcwele ungcwele uthixo
(holy holy holy lord)
