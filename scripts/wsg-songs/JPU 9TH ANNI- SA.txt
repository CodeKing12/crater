SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

I know a God, who

Faithful and gracious

I

And the thought that fills his heart

Every Morning, noon and night

He loved me when I didn

And was patient till I came

Running back into his arms

Look how he turned my life around

Making me a shining light

His glory to reveal

I will worship you forever

Love you forever because

This God is too good o

He took me from the miry clay

Set my foot upon the rock

Gave me a brand new name

His beloved and the redeemed

Made me a shinning light his glory to reveal
