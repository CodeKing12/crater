SHOUT TO THE LORD

Shout to the lord
All the earth let us sing

Power and majesty praise to the king

Mountains bow down and the sea will roar

At the sound of your name

I sing for joy
And the works of your hands

Forever I
Forever I

Nothing compares
To the promise I have in you

verse2

My Jesus my saviour
Lord there is none like you

All of my days I want to praise
The wonders of your mighty love

My comfort my shelter

Tower of refuge and strength

Let every breath
All that I am

Never cease to worship you

Nothing compares
To the promise I have in you
