My Jesus, my Savior

Lord there is none like you

All of my days

I want to praise

The wonders of your mighty love

My comfort, my shelter

Tower of refuge and strength

Let every breath, all that I am

Never cease to worship You

Shout to the Lord, all the earth let us sing

Power and majesty, praise to the King

Mountains bow down and the seas will roar

At the sound of Your name

I sing for joy at the work of your hands

Forever I'll love you, forever I'll stand

Nothing compares to the promise I have

In you
