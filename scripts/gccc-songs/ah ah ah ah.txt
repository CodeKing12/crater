ah ah ah ah

i see lightnings and thunderings
voices of Glory
all over the earth

fire x3
fire of the altar

so so so
shall it be
it won't take long anymore x2

we will be many many
millions and billions
we will be many many all over the earth

we are many many
millions and billions
we are many many all over the earth

we are many many
children and orphans
we are many many all over the earth

they are many many
millions and billions
they are many many all over the earth
