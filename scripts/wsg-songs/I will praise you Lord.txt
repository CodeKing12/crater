I'll take the step

won't mind the waters

cause I know your eyes they watch me year round

You gave your angels charge over my life

Teaching priests you gave transforming my mind

Verse
As I look to you I'm changed into the same image

oh what love you've shown

and I'll praise your name over and over again

Verse
Your light; it shined

Has captured my heart though the winds may blow

your word sails me further

How your anchor holds I can never be shuddered

Oh how beautiful your instructions we follow

Chorus
I will praise you Lord

I will bless your name

You alone I

You alone

Ohhh

Verse
As the deer panteth for the water

So my soul longeth after thee

You alone are my hearts desire and I long to worship thee

Oh oh oh oh

For You alone are my strength my shield to You alone may my spirit yield

You alone are my hearts desire and I long to worship thee
