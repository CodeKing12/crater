Chorus 1
Now I want to say
Holy is Your name
Let all creation proclaim
Holy is Your name

Verse 1
Now I praise You Lord of all creation
You ordain the sun to rise and fall
You scatter the stars across the heavens
You come close enough to hear me call

Verse 2
Your love is the shelter over my soul
You fill me with the wonder of a child
You will heal the humble and the broken
Mercy flows like a river running wild

BRIDGE
On the highest mountain
I will lift my heart to the sky
From the lowest valley
Hear my cry
