Everyone arise and let it shine
Children of our God
Your light has come
For the glory of the Lord
And beauty of His grace
Is rising on you now

Though the darkness covers
All the earth
They will see Your light
They will hear Your sound
For the glory of the Lord
And beauty of His grace
Is rising on you now

Praise Him praise Him praise Him
Arise and shine and celebrate Him
Praise Him praise Him praise Him
Let His glory rise on you

There's just something so right
About lifting His name on high
It brings us joy
And peace of mind
When we give our lives
To glorify Him so
