MINISTERING
SOLD  OUT

My God he loves me
He says I am his child

He calls me righteous
Says I'm the apple of his eye

So why do I clap my hand

And why do I stomp my feet

Why do I scream so loud

I ain't no lunatic,
I'm not fanatic

I'm just addicted
to the one who saved me

Sold out,
no matter what they say

Made up my mind
I am a fool for Christ

Sold out
every day what I do and say

Will give him all the praise...

I am a warrior

No more chains holding me
More than a conquerer

His spirit lives in me

So why do I clap my hands

And why do I stomp my feet

Why do I scream so loud

I ain't no lunatic,
I'm not fanatic

I'm just addicted to the one who saved me

Sold out,
no matter what they say

Made up my mind
I am a fool for Christ

Sold out
every day what I do and say

Will give him all the praise...

I am sold out to the one who saved me

Because of his blood I am free

I don't have time though what people might say

I'm not ashamed to give him praise

I ain't no lunatic,
I'm not fanatic

I'm just addicted
to the one who saved me
