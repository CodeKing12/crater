MINISTERING
HE TURNED IT


Yes there were times in my life when I thought I would never
make it.

I almost went down I was out for the count I was through.

But it was then when I thought it would end that I stood up again

What hell meant for evil God turned it around for my go

The devil thought he
(had me)

Thought that my life was
(over)

He thought by now I'd
(give up)

He thought I had no
(more)

But that's when someone
(greater)

Stepped in my
(situation)

My morning has now begun...

HE TURNED IT!


Sometimes I look back and I don't know how in the world I made
it

All of those nights I would cry my heart so filled with pain

Worry consumed me my whole life revolved around fear and
stress

I was tired and weak I just could not compete anymore

The devil thought he
(had me)

Thought that my life was
(over)

He thought by now I'd
(give up)

He thought I had no
(more)

But that's when someone
(greater)

Stepped in my
(situation)

My morning has now begun...

HE TURNED IT!

HE TURNED IT!

HE TURNED IT!

He turned my mourning into dancing

He turned my sorrows into joy!

He turned my mourning into dancing

He turned my sorrows into joy!

HE TURNED IT!

HE TURNED IT!

HE TURNED IT!

HE TURNED IT!

He turned my mourning into dancing

He turned my sorrows into joy!

HE TURNED IT!

HE TURNED IT!

No more crying days

No more hurt and pain

No more guilt and shame

He turned it

No more loneliness

No more fear and stress

No more sadness

He turned it


No more crying days

No more hurt and pain

No more guilt and shame

He turned it

No more loneliness

No more fear and stress

No more sadness

He turned it

HE TURNED IT!

He turned my mourning into dancing

He turned my sorrows into joy!

HE TURNED IT!

HE TURNED IT!

HE TURNED IT!

The devil thought he
(had me)...

Thought that my life was
(over)

He thought by now I'd
(give up)

He thought I had no
(more)

But that's when someone
(greater)

Stepped in my
(situation)

My morning has now begun...

HE TURNED IT!
