MINISTERING
GLORIFIED ME

I am the head and not the tail

I am above and not beneath

Distinguished by His Glorious light

To stand up where ever am found

I am a carrier of His Glory

To show forth His praises on Earth

His Glory it's risen upon me

CHORUS
God has glorified me...

The Glory of the Lord is risen
Upon me

Glorified me...
