The heavens declare you as the King of Kings

The angels they sing of your majesty oh glorious God

the whole world is subject to your decree

still you put yourself right inside of me

CHORUS
I lift up my voice to proclaim your name

All glory to God who's supreme over all

In you I find strength cause you call me your own

There's nothing I want... no

Cause you're all that I need

Almighty God, you know the end from the start

With you in my heart I've got

no worries I've already overcome

challenges may come but they will not faze me

cause the Lord of the earth dwells inside of me.

CHORUS
I lift up my voice to proclaim your name

All glory to God who's supreme over all

In you I find strength cause you call me your own

There's nothing I want... no

Cause you're all that I need
