MINISTERING
PSALM 34

I sought the Lord

And He answered me

And delivered me

From every fear

Those who look on Him

Are radiant

They'll never be ashamed

They'll never be ashamed

This poor man cried

And the Lord heard me

And saved me from

My enemies

The Son of God

Surrounds His saints

He will deliver them

He will deliver them

Magnify the Lord with me

Come exalt His name together

Glorify the Lord with me

Come exalt His name forever

O Taste and see

That the Lord is good

Oh blessed is he

Who hides in Him

Oh fear the Lord

Oh all you saints

He'll give you everything

He'll give you everything

Magnify the Lord with me

Come exalt His name together

Glorify the Lord with me

Come exalt His name forever

Magnify the Lord with me

Come exalt His name together

Glorify the Lord with me

Come exalt His name forever

Let us bless the Lord

Every day and night

Never ending praise

May our incense rise

Let us bless the Lord

Every day and night

Never ending praise

May our incense rise

Let us bless the Lord

Every day and night

Never ending praise

May our incense rise

Let us bless the Lord

Every day and night

Never ending praise

May our incense rise

Magnify the Lord with me

Come exalt His name together

Glorify the Lord with me

Come exalt His name forever

Magnify the Lord with me

Come exalt His name together

Glorify the Lord with me

Come exalt His name forever

Oh Taste and see

That the Lord is good

He'll give you everything

He'll give you everything
