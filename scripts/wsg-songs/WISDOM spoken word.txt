Wisdom

James 1:5
If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God,

that giveth to all men liberally,
and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.

Isaiah 2:3
And many people shall go and say, Come ye,
and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD,

to the house of the God of Jacob;
and he will teach us of his ways,

and we will walk in his paths:
for out of Zion shall go forth the law,

and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.

Ecclesiastes 2:26
For God giveth to a man that is good

in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy:
but to the sinner he giveth travail,

to gather and to heap up,
that he may give to him that is good before God.

This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.

Psalms 16:7
I will bless the LORD,

who hath given me counsel:
my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.

Proverbs 2:5-6
Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD,

and find the knowledge of God.
For the LORD giveth wisdom:

out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.

Psalms 51:6
Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts:

and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.

1 John 5:20
And we know that the Son of God is come,

and hath given us an understanding,
that we may know him that is true,

and we are in him that is true,
even in his Son Jesus Christ.

This is the true God, and eternal life.

2 Corinthians 4:6
For God, who commanded them
light to shine out of darkness,

hath shined in our hearts,

to give the light of the knowledge of the
glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.

Proverbs 28:5
Evil men understand not judgment:

but they that seek the LORD understand all things.
