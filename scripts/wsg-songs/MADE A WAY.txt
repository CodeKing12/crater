MADE A WAY

Made a way

I see how and you did it

Made a way

verse 1
Standing here not knowing how we'll get through this test

But holding onto faith you know best

Nothing can catch you by surprise

You've got this figured out and you're watching us now

But when it looks as if we can't win

You wrapped us in your arm and stepped in

And everything we need you supply

You got this in control

And now we know that

chorus
You made a way

When our backs were against the wall

And it looked as if it was over

You made a way

And we're standing here

Only because you made a way

You made a way

verse 2
Now we're here

Looking back on where we come from

Because of you and nothing we've done

To deserve the love and mercy you've shown

But your grace was strong enough to pick us up

chorus
And you made a way

When our backs were against the wall

And it looked as if it was over

You made a way

And we're standing here

Only because you made a way

Only because you made a way

bridge
You move mountains

You cause walls to fall

With your power

You perform miracles

There is nothing that's impossible

And we're standing here

Only because you made a way

bridge 2
You made a way...

I see how and you did it,

Made a way

I know how and you did it,

Made a way

I see how and you did it...

I see how and I'm grateful...

And we're standing here

Only because you made

Oh Oh Oh...

All things are working for my good

'Cause it's Intentional,
Never failing

I know that all things are working for my good

It's Intentional,
Never failing...

All things are working for my good

It's Intentional,
Never failing...

All things are working for my good...

It's intentional...

It's Intentional,
Never failing...

Oh Oh Oh...

I don't have to worry 'cause,
He's working for me,

He's working for me...

It's Intentional,
Never failing...

Oh Oh Oh
(It's Intentional)

Never failing...

Oh Oh Oh...

And ain't over till is good

You don't have to worry 'cause,
He's working for me,

And we're standing here

Only because you made a way

And we're standing here

Only because you made

You move mountains

You cause walls to fall

You cause chains to break

Giants fall...

'Cause you move mountains

You move mountains

And everything is easy for you

'Cause you move mountains

Yes you move mountains

Mountains are moving...

Strong holds are breaking...

'Cause you move mountains

When the devil said no, you said yes

When they pronounced me dead, you said not yet

When they called me dead, you said not yet

You cause walls to fall

With your power

You perform miracles
