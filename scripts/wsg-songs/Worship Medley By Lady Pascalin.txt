I love your voice you have led me through the fire

In darkest nights you were close like no other

i've known you as a father i've known you as a friend

i have lived in the goodness of God

All my life you have been faithful

All my life you have been so so good

With every breath that i am able

i will sing of the Goodness of God

For you oh lord are a shield for me

You're my Glory and the lifter of my head

We hail you we worship you

We hail you most high
