MINISTERING
MY LIGHT SHINES

All power belongs to God

As He is,so am I in this world

I'm not afraid of the terror by night

Nor the flying arrow by day

Because greater is He that lives in me

Than He that is in the world

Because greater is He that lives in me

Than He that is in the world

Nothing can stand against me
And prevail

All the  walls are falling down

I'm the light in the midst of darkness

and my light shines every where

My light shines everywhere

My light shines everywhere

My light shines everywhere

My light shines everywhere

My light shines everywhere

My light shines everywhere

My light shines everywhere

My light shines everywhere

The mark of God is upon me

If God be for me who can be against me?

Nobody

Greater is He that lives in me

Than He that is in the world

Greater is He that lives in me

Than He that is in the world

Nothing can stand against me
And prevail

All the walls are falling down

I'm the light in the midst of darkness

and my light shines every where

Nothing can stand against me
And prevail

All the walls are falling down

I'm the light in the midst of darkness

and my light shines every where

My light shines everywhere

My light shines everywhere

My light shines everywhere

My light shines everywhere

My light shines everywhere

My light shines everywhere

My light shines everywhere

My light shines everywhere

Nothing, nothing nothing can bring me down

Nothing, nothing nothing can bring me down

Nothing, nothing nothing can bring me down

Nothing, nothing nothing can bring me down

Nothing can stand against me
And prevail

All the walls are falling down

I'm the light in the midst of darkness

And my light shines everywhere

Nothing can stand against me
And prevail

All the walls are fallen down

I'm the light in the midst of darkness

And my light shines everywhere

My light shines every where

My light shines every where

My light shines every where

My light shines every where

My light shines every where

My light shines every where

My light shines every where

My light shines every where
