SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

How majestic is Your name, oh Lord

In all the earth

Your name is strong and mighty

Your name is glorious and great

In Him we're saved

The name of Jesus higher than other names

King of all Kings, no other name like His

The name of Jesus higher than other names

Alpha and Omega, no other name like His

Your name like sweet perfume

Poured upon my soul, yeah

In Your name we overcome

In His name there's victory

His name is powerful

The name of Jesus higher than other names

King of all Kings, no other name like His

The name of Jesus higher than other names

Alpha and Omega, no other name like His

The name of Jesus higher than other names

King of all Kings, no other name like His

The name of Jesus higher than other names

Alpha and Omega, no other name like His

Every other god they are deader than dead

Jesus died and rose again

We lift Him higher

In Your name every knee shall bow

In Your name all men are saved

We call upon the name

Call that name
(Jesus)

Oh oh oh
(Jesus)

Call that name
(Jesus)

Ohohoh
(Jesus)
