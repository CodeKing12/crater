"Na Who Be Your Daddy Medley"

Na who be your be daddy..

Na YAH be my daddy..

One time for the winner man

One time for the winner man

One time, two times...

For the winner man

Night and day is a party for me

cause my father steady caring for me

all the haters with their busy body

all the blessings you dey confirm

Me go tell em say you confirm

I dey feeling the way that you do

When I wake up

All I see is

Your goodness Lord

Spreads around me

No matter what it is that ever comes my way

I'll surely sing my song

I wanna go RABABABA

When the bad man them a think say them dey do me strong thing

Them no know say them a swerving, them a dulling

Cause Baba God dey strong for my side me I fear no nothing

All the things you dey do for me Baba I dey reason say

You are good (You are good)

You are God o (You are God oh)

Once upon a time ('pun a time)

See my life was in total blackness

And I be like yes sir (yes sir)

To the man with the darker soul

But then you came around and turned my life around

Now I gat a good life na na na...

It was really nice to meet you (meet you. meet you. meet you)

It was really nice to meet you (meet you. meet you. meet you)

When the bad man them a think say them dey do me strong thing

Them no know say them a swerving, them a dulling

Cause Baba God dey strong for my side me I fear no nothing

All the things you dey do for me Baba I dey reason say

Pause!

These days you dey blow my mind you dey make me jolly

You bless me Baba eh! Now I dey getti money

Every time I call you dey pick your phone
