A Hymn Of Glory Let Us Sing

A hymn of glory let us sing
New songs throughout the world shall ring
Alleluia, Alleluia.
Christ, by a road before untrod
Ascendeth to the throne of God.
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

The holy apostolic band
Upon the Mount of Olives stand
Alleluia, Alleluia.
And with His followers they see
Jesus' resplendent majesty
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

To Whom the angels drawing nigh,
"Why stand and gaze upon the sky?"
Alleluia, Alleluia.
"This is the Savior," thus they say.
"This is His noble triumph day."
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.

"Again ye shall behold Him so,
As ye have today seen Him go."
Alleluia, Alleluia.
"In glorious pomp ascending high
Up to the portals of the sky."
Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia.
