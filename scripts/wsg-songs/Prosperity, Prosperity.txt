Prosperity, Prosperity

Prosperity, I'm in great prosperity.

Verse

I walk in abundance

I walk in favor

I move in the spirit

With the speed of the holyghost

No limitations

I'm spreading everywhere

I permeate

I am fruitful, I prosper

Chorus
Prosperity, Prosperity

Prosperity, I'm in great prosperity.

Walking In abundance moving with the speed of the holy ghost I am favoured
It's a new level
Am taking over

I speak healing, testimonies, miracles, favour, blessings, prosperity now

You are great you are kind you are good

Increase on everyside

( I testify)
