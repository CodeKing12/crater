The fragrance of my worship rose up to the Father

Noise thunderings earthquakes Were the response to my worship


First it was fragrance

Then it turned to fire

My worship is my weapon

This is how I win my battle this is how I win my battle

First it was fragrance

Then it turned to fire

My worship is my weapon

This is how I win my battle

This is how I win win win

This is how I win

The smoke of my worship released upon the earth
