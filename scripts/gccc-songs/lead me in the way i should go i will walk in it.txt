lead me in the way i should go
i'll walk in it

guide me in the path i should tread
i'll walk through it

Tell me what you want me to do
i'll get it done

not power
not by might
by the spirit of the living God

there is safety in your word
there is safety in your voice
there is safety in your arms
i would rather be here Lord
