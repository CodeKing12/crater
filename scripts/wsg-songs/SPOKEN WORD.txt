Perfect!

Amazing!

He knew me in advance

Oh Yes he did!

Right before the time

Before i took my first breathe

I've been in him, In God,  MY LORD

Carefully designed in Splendour

Making feasts in abundance of life

But even at that, I came into the World

and unconsciously joined the wild...

Cruising around the world like a lost sheep

TAG
The craziness of the world engrossed my human nature

The World, A Crazy Orchestra

And I the Dancer

You can readily tell who we became

Void!

Hey! Look at that Man

Who? ....

WHAT! WHY! WHO DID THIS TO HIM?

Look at...

Blood Everywhere

Ouch, that hurts...

No...Stop it

Why are they beating him?

Who laid that burden on him?

Why Crown him with thorns?

This is not funny...

Nails in the Hands?

Ouch!

YOU'RE HURTING HIM

Hey What's that?

It feels like a power rising from the Grave

I can sense a Strength coming up in my bowels

As an incense, a royal  virtue covers me like a presence

That beautiful Cross

The Blood was shed

My Sin was cleansed.

The Devil was tamed

Look at me

I rose with him in power

Look at me

Conformed to the image of the living son of God

I rose with him

Oh Hallelujah

I'm resurrected

I'm Conformed

I am Justified

I am glorified

Living in the Predestination of my God

Now And Evermore

Amen
