Down at Your feet, oh
Is the most high place
In Your presence, Lord
I seek your face, seek

There is no higher
Then to bow and kneel
I am amazed at Your
Oh Lord, I live to

Oh Lord, I live to

I am amazed at Your
Oh Lord, I live to

Then to bow and kneel
I am amazed at Your
Oh Lord, I live to

Down at Your feet, oh
Is the most high place
