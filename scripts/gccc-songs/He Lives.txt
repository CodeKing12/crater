Verse 1
I've got something to sing about
I've got something to shout about
I've got something to tell the world about
I've got something to live for
I've got something worth dying for
I've got something to tell the world about

Chorus 1
He lives He lives I know my Savior lives
He lives He lives His life has set me free
I've got something to sing about
I've got something to shout about
I've got something to tell the world about
I stand here forgiven
Abundant life I'm liven'
Because He lives all these things I've found

BRIDGE
There have been many who claimed
That they were God but in those graves
Their bones remain but in the tomb
Where my Jesus once was laid
There's nothing there that's why I have to say
