He who promises to love me through the Morning

Sing songs all through the night

Say my life is Gods Prayer oh oh oh

Now that i choose to fix my eyes on you alone

You put a smile on my Face

And I'll be praising and praising and praising again

Ohh oh ohh ohh oh

I'll keep praising o

a thousand by my left

a thousand by my right

I'll keep praising

though the storms will come

and though the winds may blow

my praise will remain

I'll keep praising o

generations to generations
