MINISTERING
I SEE HIM

Verse1
I can see Him from afar
With fire in His eyes

He
He

Chorus
I see Him standing by the door

With fire in His eyes and healing
in His wings to heal

Someone who believes open up your heart
He

Verse2
Life is more than just a dream

How far can you see

What you say is who you are

If you believe you will receive

Chorus
I see Him standing by the door

With fire in His eyes and healing
in His wings to heal

Someone who believes open up your heart
He

Bridge
Should I go, should I stay

There is fire in my eyes and healing in my wings

Whatever you want is here today

Just open up your hear and let me hear
Finine

And I hear God speaking through my mouth

Seeing through my eyes
with fire in His eyes to heal

Someone who believe
just open up your heart

He
