Verse 2
Oya na owo e soke
(Lift up your hands)

My God You keep me Ok

The devil tried to stop me
But no way

Cos I'm covered
I have a father Pastor T

So I'm calm, cos I'm in his palm
And you know in your arm no harm

That's why I give you all the praise
All the glory and the honour
You are my father, you protect me

My provider, my Redeemer

Can't tell it all

Pick me from miry clay

Set me on the rock to stay
Made me a champion

Like I

Halleluyah it's a new day, new day

And he's given us a new name, new name

Walk in the season of the new

Cos it's in you

Giving God the glory
Thank you Lord
