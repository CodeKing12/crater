# Quick Scripture Search

Crater's quick search feature lets you jump directly to any Bible verse by typing a simple reference. This is the fastest way to find scripture during a service.

## What is Quick Search?

Quick search (also called "special search mode") allows you to type a scripture reference like you would say it, and Crater finds it instantly.

**Examples:**
- `John 3:16` → John chapter 3, verse 16
- `Genesis 1:1` → Genesis chapter 1, verse 1  
- `Psalm 23:1` → Psalm 23, verse 1
- `Matt 5:3` → Matthew chapter 5, verse 3

## Enabling Quick Search Mode

The Scripture tab has two search modes:

1. **Quick Search Mode** (tree icon) - Type references like "John 3:16"
2. **Text Search Mode** (magnifying glass) - Search for words within verses

### Switching Modes

1. Look for the search icon in the Scripture tab search bar
2. Click the icon to toggle between modes
3. The tree icon indicates Quick Search mode
