VERSE 1
Who has set prisoners free
Who has made the blind man see

Who has found the once lost sheep
Whose love is so deep

He has conquered sin and death
All for us to have the wealth

He had no riches on earth
He is king of all yet

CHORUS
So gi bu Chi
So gi bu Chi mo

So gi bu Chineke nna
You're the one oh Lord

VERSE 2
With you I am not afraid
With you I'm strengthened by faith

Your love is my warm embrace
Thank you for you grace

That we may not be deceived
You sent the Holy Spirit

We are yours, from your roots we grow
You have given us hope

CHORUS
So gi bu Chi
So gi bu Chi mo

So gi bu Chineke nna
You're the one oh Lord


BRIDGE
