MINISTERING
JOY

There's beauty in my royalty

I've got true love instead of pain

There's freedom though you've captured me

I've got joy instead of mourning

You give me joy

Down deep in my soul...

BRIDGE
I've never been so free,
caught in your love for me
(He loves me)

Never been more secure knowing your heart Lord
(so glad he loves me)

You give me joy

Down deep in my soul...
