SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

I'm free indeed

In Christ I'm free indeed

No chains are holding me

It's who I choose to be

I choose to be free

And Jesus is my life

And I'm changing the world

I heard that you were wondering

If God still answers prayer

I heard that  you are searching for a sign

That he was still right there

Everytime you shake  my hands oh yeah

Everytime you see me dance oh yeah

You can tell by looking

But i ain't get the time to tell you all you really

Need to know is

I'll raise the banner

1...2...1....2....3

My redeemer lives

I'm living breathing walking talking moving miracles

People said i'll never they said I'll never ever but Stop look watch

Cause  I am ....

I am yea

Oya now

Oya

Oya now

yea yea

Uh yeah i'm a champion

Put your hands up in the air

Am a champion
