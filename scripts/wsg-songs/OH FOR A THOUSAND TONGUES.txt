Verse 1
O for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer
The glories of my God and King,
The triumphs of His grace.
My gracious Master and my God,
Assist me to proclaim,
To spread through all the earth abroad,
The honors of Thy name.

Verse 3

He sets the prisoner free;
His blood can make the foulest clean;
His blood availed for me.

So now Thy blessed Name I love,
Thy will would e
Had I a thousand hearts to give,
My Lord, they all were Thine!
