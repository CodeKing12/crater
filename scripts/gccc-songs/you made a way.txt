You made a way
When our backs were against the wall
And it looked as if it was over
You made a way
And we're standing here
Only because You made a way

And you move mountains
And you move mountains
You cause walls to fall
With Your power
You perform miracles
There is nothing that's impossible
And we're standing here
Only because You made a way
