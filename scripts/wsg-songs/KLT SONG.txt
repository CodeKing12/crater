Here is our prayer

This is a new season

We have a Prophecy

Yes the light of the LORD

Illuminates the World

And the Kingdom of our God

Covers the earth through us

Not by power nor by Might

By My Spirit says the Lord

We're spreading with power

Increasing in number

We're soaring higher

Expanding with Grace

Hallelujah Amen

Where the Lord is the builder

Fashioned In splendor

And Great Wisdom

We will reign and take the world

Yes we will reign and take the world

By My Spirit says the Lord

We're spreading with power

Increasing in number

We're soaring higher

Expanding with Grace
