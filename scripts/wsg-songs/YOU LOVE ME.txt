Verse 1
Your love! The greatest thing I have my Lord

You made a sculpture and you made him Living by your Word

If I don't understand your works I guess the boy is not a god

Or lemme say I don't believe in gods cause I am God

Your type of loving is not a Canal type

Your type of love is like a food, maybe the Manner type

Oh Yeah! You sent your son to condemn the world

So your love may Prevail and wickedness may Dissolve

Divine love from above is my heritage in Christ

Cause he came up from heaven so he could pay the Price

For my sins and thereby make me Clean

And then I take the message to the saints and 'em Clean

If I say I love God, I love Jesus and Myself

Or I say love the world, I love his people to be saved

From captivity and being slaves to the things of the world

For by his Love, we got 'em all

VERSE
You not alone

I'll hold your hand

I'll help you

To understand

Oh...

Can't nobody

The Lord has been kind

been so wonderful

He is so awesome

Oh...

God has blesses me always

Oh I thank you lord for all the things you've done for me

Oh I thank you for being my healing, my protector

Loed I thank you for being my father, my mother

Oh... yeah

You loved me

On my feet

Happily excited
