GIVER OF ALL

VERSE 1
O Lord of heav'n and earth and sea,
To Thee all praise and glory be;
How shall we show our love to Thee,
Giver of all!

VERSE 2
The golden sunshine, vernal air,
Sweet flow'rs and fruits, Thy love declare
Where harvests ripen, Thou art there,
Giver of all!

VERSE 3
For peaceful homes and healthful days,
For all the blessings earth displays,
We owe Thee thankfulness and praise,
Giver of all!

VERSE 4
Thou didst not spare Thine only Son,
But gav'st Him for a world undone,
And freely with that Blessed One,
Thou givest all!

VERSE 5
Thou giv'st the Holy Spirit's dow'r
Spirit of life, and love, and pow'r,
And dost His sev'nfold graces show'r
Upon us all.

VERSE 6
For souls redeemed, for sins forgiv'n,
For means of grace, and hopes of Heav'n,
Father, what can to Thee be giv'n,
Who givest all?

VERSE 7
We lose what on ourselves we spend:
We have as treasure without end
Whatever, Lord, to Thee we lend,
Who givest all!

VERSE 8
Whatever, Lord, we lend to Thee
Repaid a thousandfold will be,
Then gladly will we give to Thee
Giver of all!

VERSE 9
To Thee, from whom we all derive
Our life, our gifts, our pow'r to give
Oh, may we ever with Thee live.
Giver of all!


Amen.
