Great is Thy faithfulness
O God my Father

There is no shadow of turning with Thee
Thou changest not

Thy compassions they fail not
As Thou hast been Thou forever will be

Great is Thy faithfulness
Great is Thy faithfulness

Morning by morning new mercies I see
And all I have needed Thy hand hath provided

Great is Thy faithfulness
Lord unto me

Pardon for sin
And a peace that endureth

Thine own dear presence to cheer
And to guide

Strength for today
and bright hope for tomorrow

Blessings all mine, with ten thousand beside
