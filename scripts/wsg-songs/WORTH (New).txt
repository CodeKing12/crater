WORTH

You thought I was worth saving

So you came and changed my life

You thought I was worth keeping

So you cleaned me up inside

You thought I was to die for

So you sacrificed your life

So I could be free

So I could be whole

So I could tell everyone I know

You thought I was worth saving

So you came and changed my life

You thought I was worth keeping

So you cleaned me up inside

You thought I was to die for

So you sacrificed your life

So I could be free

So I could be whole

So I could tell everyone I know

You thought I was worth saving

So you came and changed my life

You thought I was worth keeping

So you cleaned me up inside

You thought I was to die for

So you sacrificed your life

So I could be free

So I could be whole

So I could tell everyone I know

You thought I was worth saving

So you came and changed my life

You thought I was worth keeping

So you cleaned me up inside

You thought I was to die for

So you sacrificed your life

So I could be free

So I could be whole

So I could tell everyone I know
