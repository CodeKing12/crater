SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

Glorious God,
Beautiful king,
Excellent God,

We bow before your throne

We bow before your throne,
Worship at your feet

Bow before your throne,
You are a glorious God

How can I describe
the God that

How can I explain
the love that

I've even lost the words

My heart sings,
Oh oh oh

Your goodness, your mercy and your kindness
Towards me

Your love is so amazing
Brings me to my knees

Oh oh oh gonna love you forever

Call: Lord you are like a river that
Resp: never runs dry

Call: my heart is your temple
Resp: live inside

Call: lord you are the air I breath
Resp: keep me alive

Call: lord I need you close please
Resp: keep me alive

You won

And all that I have won

How much I love you

Call: Lord am gonna try
Resp: try
