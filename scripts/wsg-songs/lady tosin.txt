Blessed are those who run to Him

Who place their hope and confidence in Jesus

He won

Blessed are those who seek His face

Who bend their knee and fix their gaze on Jesus

They won

Sing if you love His Name

Come on and lift your voice with me

He

Blessed are those who walk with Him

Whose h?arts are set on pilgrimage with J?sus

They

Blessed are those who die to live

Whose joy it is to give it all for Jesus

And for Him only
