NEW SEASON

It's a new season, it's a new day

A fresh anointing is flowing my way

It's a season of power and prosperity

It's a new season, coming to me

It's a new season, it's a new day

A fresh anointing is flowing my way

It's a season of power and prosperity

It's a new season

It's a new season

Coming to me

It's a new season, it's a new day

A fresh anointing is flowing my way

It's a season of power and prosperity

It's a new season

It's a new season

It's a new season

It's a new season

The devil's time is up, no longer can he bother me

'Cause the Creator of the universe, He fathers me

And it's transferable, my children's children will be free

It's a new season
(It's a new season)

All that was stolen is returned to you a hundred fold

Tried in the fire but you're coming out gold

Cling to His hand, yes, to every promise take a hold

It's a new season
(It's a new season)

It's a new season, it's a new day

A fresh anointing is flowing my way

It's a season of power and prosperity

It's a new season coming to me

It's a new season
