HOLY HOLY HOLY ARE YOU LORD

VERSE
can you hear the sound of heaven

Like the sound of many waters

The sound of worship
coming from the throne

There are cries of adoration as men from every Nation

lift their voice to make his glory known

holy, holy, holy are you lord

Holy holy holy are you lord

The elders and the angels bow

the redeemed worship you LORD

Holy holy holy are you LORD

VERSE
I can here the sound of heaven

Like the sound of many waters

The sound of worship
coming from the throne

There are cries of adoration as men from every Nation

lift their voice to make his glory known

holy, holy, holy are you lord

Holy holy holy are you lord

The heavens and angels bow

the redeemed worship you now
