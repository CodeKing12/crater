Chorus 1
Show me Your glory
Send down Your presence
I want to see Your face
Show me Your glory
Majesty shines about You
I can't go on without You Lord

Verse 1
I caught a glimpse of Your splendor
In the corner of my eye
The most beautiful thing I've ever seen
And it was like a flash of lightning
Reflected off the sky
And I know I'll never be the same

Verse 2
When I climb down the mountain
And get back to my life
I won't settle for ordinary things
I'm gonna follow You forever
For all of my days
I won't rest 'til I see You again
