This year

Is my set time

It is well and good

Things are not like before

Greater achievements

Greater victories, yes

I know that God has installed for me

Things to make me spread my wings

And soar higher

Higher

I'm thankful for the life You gave to me

For the love You showed

I'm grateful for the peace and loving kindness

You lavished on me

Oh Lord I appreciate the things that You do

So much to say

Not by power or might

It's by the spirit

And I know

This year surely is greater

Surely is better than ever before

This is my season

This year I keep flying higher

Shinning brighter than ever before

This is my season

Ooo ooo

Oh oh oh

Ooo ooo

Oh oh oh

This year doors are opened

Things are working out

For my good

I'm thankful for the life You gave to me

For the love You showed

I'm grateful for the peace and loving kindness

You lavished on me

Oh Lord I appreciate the things that You do

So much to say

Not by power or might

It's by the spirit

Yes I know

This year surely is greater

Surely is better than ever before

This is my season

This year I keep flying higher

Shinning brighter than ever before

This is my season

For the glory of the latter

Will be greater than the former

Do you believe

Yes I believe

Ooo

This season I'm spreading

One thousand fold increase

Everywhere!

This year surely is greater

Surely is better than ever before

This is my season

This year I keep flying higher

Shinning brighter than ever before

This is my season

This year surely is greater

Surely is better than ever before

This is my season

This year I keep flying higher

Shinning brighter than ever before

This is my season

Ooo ooo

Oh oh oh

Ooo ooo

Oh oh oh
