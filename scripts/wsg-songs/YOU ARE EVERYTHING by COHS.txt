You're the only one we see
Even in our very dreams

When we think about your grace
We're changed into the same image.


You are everything
That we are

You are why we live
Why we breathe

It's all because of you
JESUS!

You are in us and we're in You
You are Everything


You came to earth to pay the price
That was the greatest sacrifice.

For our sins, you were crucified
And now, you have given us your life.


We will preach the gospel
To the ends of the earth.

You've given us the power
And now we are your witness.

Every knee will bow down
And every tongue will confess.

Jesus Christ is Lord
Jesus Christ is Lord!
