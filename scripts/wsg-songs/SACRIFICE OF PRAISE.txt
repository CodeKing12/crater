We pour out sacrifice of praise daily to You our God

The fruit of our lips giving thanks to Your name

We acknowledge You
The Saviour and Master of our lives

We worship you in Spirit and truth

Our love for you radiates as the brightness of the sun

You are good
Oh you are good

Doesn't matter what they say
Oh You are good

We lift up our voices to proclaim your holy name mighty God

All glory and honour we give to he who reigns Lord over all

We cast our crown down and bow in reverence to you Lord

With joy in our hearts we will remain in your grace forever more

You are good
Oh you are good

Doesn't matter what they say

You are good

I will sing like david sang
Pouring myself all out to you

I will dance like david danced
Giving you the praise you deserve

You are good
Oh you are good

Doesn't matter what they say

You are good
