Truly john 3:16 was written because

Jesus came to give us salvation. YES!

But for real, men and brethren,

he's no longer in the world as we all can see

He came for the great assignment

of saving all men and

john 10:10 was one of the words that accompanied his mission.

He came that we might have life

and even to have it more abundantly

In fact check your john 16:7

our Lord Jesus said

It is expedient for us

that he goes away

And for if he goes not away,

the comforter will not come unto us.

Don't be confused brother,

I am not here to preach.

This is a service of honor for our LEGEND.

And i'm here to talk about the help

the Lord has sent to us.

For God so loved the world

that he gave us bishop Temple omolehin.

What if God didn't send Pastor Temple Omolehin

What if he didn't say yes to the call

Someone like me should be lost In destiny by now

(Once a club guy with innumerable company of girlfriends)

Back in the days when I was called toasting machine.

I remember then, once we were done with Sunday services,

our second service held at a club house called Beat at tanke

I Got into a lot of things that could ruin a destiny.

But God brought pastor victor ajibaye my way.

Meanwhile we had been together since primary school days

but I didn't know that

I was already with the one

that will usher my destiny straight to

oluwatumibi Temple Alaye'nbo Omolehin

and he has fashioned me into a preacher of the word.

I have met wolves in pastors

But our father oluwatumibi stands out

I have met money mongers,

but our father is ne'er moved by money.

In fact, that you are rich

is the reason why you won't gain access to him

Have you seen sacrifice before?

If no, then find teacher Temple Omolehin

A teacher per excellence

A leader with a large heart

A mentor to many

Consistency in person

Our beloved central minister of MPCPD PUSH

Our arch bishop

Our strength

Our life giver

Our instructor

Our revelation

Our source of inspiration

Our our own father

The baba isale of chapel of reconciliation

Happy birthday to the author of life class

Happy birthday to our raiser

Happy birthday to our very own esteemed

Teacher Temple Alayenbo Oluwatumibi Omolehin

Long live the king

Long live the priest

Long live word sanctuary
