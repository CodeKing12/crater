O come all ye faithful

Joyful and triumphant

Oh come ye, oh come ye

To Bethlehem

Come and behold him

born the king of angels

Oh come let us adore him

Christ the Lord

Sing choirs of angles

Sing in exaltation

Sing all ye citizens of heaven above

Glory to God

Glory in the highest

Oh come let us adore him

Christ the Lord

We give you all the glory

Him Christ the
Lord

We sing with angels holy

Him Christ the
lord

You're Christ the Lord,

we know,
we know, you are

You're Christ the Lord

You deserve the glory

You're worthy of it all

For from you are all things

And to you are all things

You deserve the glory

I'll be like Mary,

and pour my oil all out

I'll be like Mary

and pour my oil all out

it's all I have left

You're Worthy of it all

I'll be like Mary

and pour what cost me out,

You're Worthy of it all

For from you are all things

And to you are all things

You deserve the glory

We give you all the glory

We worship you our God

You are worthy

To be praised
