BISHOP TEMPLE
MINISTERING
CANDLE NIGHT

verse1
Here is the candle night

Jesus bled and died

In that candle night

What a terrible night

But while that candle burns

Jesus is working

Working my success

Threshing the floor

And that candle burns
And that candle burns

Chorus
Candle night
Candle night
Candle night
Candle night

What a night
What a night

Oh what a night what a night

And this candle burns

After this candle burn

But it

And the day will break

And the night will leave

Joy is here

This is broad day light

And I

My blessings

Yeah!

Joy is here

Verse2
This candle will soon burn to the roots

What will you do after it burns

Or don

It will take some time

And this candle burns
And this candle burns

Chorus
Candle night
Candle night
Candle night
Candle night

What a night
What a night

Oh what a night what a night
