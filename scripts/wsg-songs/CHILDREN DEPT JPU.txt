We are the Church, We take the World
With the soul winning we do
Our Father, sustainer, redeemer, he raised us


If you want to be great, you have to elevate
I don
Whenever I  pray,  my prayers are answered
Prayer is what God does and what we do

We are preaching the Truth Connectivity in participation
And if you listen to our words, you have salvation, healings and
Fathers and mothers join the train and let

We are the Church, We take the World
With the soul winning we do

All the nations belong to God, because all the nations are designed for God
We take the nations, we global now

This we preach to all the nations and they receive
This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached to all nations
And all the nations shall flow to it

We are one nation, we are one nation
We are the Church, We take the World
With the soul winning we do

nations
(nations)

We take the nations.
