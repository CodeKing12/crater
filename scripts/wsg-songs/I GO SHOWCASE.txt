I've got the life of God in me

I'm gonna shine and let them see

Greater is he in me

Nothing go fit to turn my heart from you.

I go showcase ooo my love for you

You are my world nothing compares...

VERSE
I preach for a living

Cause it's one thing that you've commanded me to do

Like the sun I keep shinning oo

I'm a city set upon the hill

Ministry is life

so I no dey joke when I tell you say

e be my work

No life outside ministry

Witnessing na him be my work

VERSE
That's why I call you my
