You won't relent until You have it all
My heart is Yours
You won't relent until You have it all
My heart is Yours (sing that again)

You won't relent until You have it all
My heart is Yours
You won't relent until You have it all
My heart is Yours

I set You as a seal upon my heart
As a seal upon my arm
For there is love
That is as strong as death
Jealousy demanding as the grave
And many waters cannot quench this love

Come be the fire inside of me
Come be the flame upon my heart
Come be the fire inside of me
Until You and I are one (sing it again)
Come be the fire inside of me
Come be the flame upon my heart
Come be the fire inside of me
Until You and I are one
Oh, we are one
Yeah-eah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh the fire in me, fire in me, yeah

I don't wanna talk about You
Like You're not in the room
Wanna look right at You
Wanna sing right to You
I don't wanna talk about You
Like You're not in the room
Wanna look right at You
Wanna sing right to You
I don't wanna talk about You
Like You're not in the room
Wanna look right at You
Wanna sing right to You

There's nothing we want more
There's nothing we want more
There's nothing we want more
