Chorus 1
I've got a mansion
Just over the hilltop
In that bright land
Where we'll never grow old
And someday yonder
We will never more wander
But walk the streets
That are purest gold

Verse 1
I'm satisfied
With just a cottage below
A little silver
And a little gold
But in that city
Where the ransomed will shine
I want a gold one
That's silver lined

Verse 2
Tho' often tempted
Tormented and tested
And like the prophet
My pillow's a stone
And tho' I find here
No permanent dwelling
I know He'll give me
A mansion my own

Verse 3
Don't think me poor
Or deserted or lonely
I'm not discouraged
I'm heaven bound
I'm just a pilgrim
In search of a city
I want a mansion
A harp and a crown
