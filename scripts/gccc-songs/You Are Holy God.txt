Chorus 1
You are holy holy
You are holy God
You are holy holy
You are holy God

Verse 1
Here in this quiet place
I rest in Your embrace
Here in these tender moments with You
I see You on the throne
I trust in You alone
Here in these quiet moments with You

Verse 2
Here in the stillness of
Your pure anointed love
I cherish every moment with You
I feel Your beating heart
But I only know in part
The fullness of each moment with You
