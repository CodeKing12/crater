I love You, Lord
For Your mercy never
All my days, I've been
From the moment that I
Until I lay my head
Oh, I will sing of the

I will sing of the

all my life You have
And all my life You have
With every breath that I
Oh, I will sing of the

I love Your voice
You have led me
In the darkest night
You are close like no
I've known You as a
I've known You as a
And I have lived in the

Your goodness is
It's running after me

Your goodness is
It's running after me
With my life laid down
I'm surrendered now
I give You everything
Your goodness is
It's running after me

Your goodness is
It's running after me
faithful God
