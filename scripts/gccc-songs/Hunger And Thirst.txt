Verse 1
I hunger and thirst for You
I hunger and thirst for You
In the desert of my need
You're the fountain that I seek
You're the Living Water I keep running to
I hunger and thirst for You
I hunger and thirst for You

Verse 2
I hunger and thirst for You
I hunger and thirst for You
Heaven's Manna Bread of Life
Fill the emptiness inside
Nothing else can satisfy me like You do
I hunger and thirst for You
I hunger and thirst for You
