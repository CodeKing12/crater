I will bless the lord

evry chance i get

my lungs will expand

expand with his praise

i live and breathe God

Join me in spreading the news

lift my eyes to the hills for whence cometh my help

my help comes from the lord

its only you

its only you

its only you

oh oh oh

its only you

when i lift my hands in worship

it belongs to you lord

it belongs to you lord

i see what youre doing

i like what youre doing

i love how you talk to me

i love how you walk with me

CONSTANT fellowship with the Father and me

i love how you talk to me

just dey Father me dey go
