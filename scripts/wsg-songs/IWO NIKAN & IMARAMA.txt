WORD SANCTUARY CHOIR
MINISTERING
IWO NIKAN & IMARAMA

verse1
No other place I rather be
Am hanging out with You

cos no one esle fufill my dream
like the way you do

Lord you've been my everything
and everything is you

Lord you've been so good to me
like no body would

I never thought you'll save
after all the wrong have done

but in your love and mercy you found me
and this is my song

chorus
Iwo nikan ni all I want

Ogo ye O my all in all

BABA

verse2
There be many things to break
may be many more to come

But His Love and Grace will not depart

And His grace to lead you on


where are my Accussers
where are my foes
where are my detractors

you have to let me go
you are my provider
you are my source


Lord you are lift me High


chorus
Iwo nikan ni all I want

Ogo ye O
My all in all

BABA

Anytime I call you, you come

And anytime I need you, you respond

I never thought you save me after all
the wrong i've done

but in your love and mercy you found me
and this is my song


Lord I stand in awe of you

I stand in awe of you
for you are God Almighty

who reign forever and forever

where you are is where i want to be

Halleluyah halle
