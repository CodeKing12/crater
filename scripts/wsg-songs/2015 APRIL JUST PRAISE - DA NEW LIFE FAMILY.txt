Halleluyah...

you have won it all for me

Death could not hold you down

You are the risen king

Sited in majesty

You are the risien king

You are God alone...

From before time began

You are God alone You are on your throne

And right now In the good times and bad

You are on your throne alone

You are God alone

There

Have searched all over

Couldn

I looked high and low

Still couldn

Nobody greater,nobody great

Nobody greater than you

We give glory to God

Glory to God
For ever

All the glory belong to yoU

All the glory belong to you oh God

Halleluyah...
