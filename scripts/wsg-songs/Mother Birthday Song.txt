You're my Joy, my friend, my lover

You're  my meditation, my motivation

Thank you for being good

Thank you for being good

Thank you for being good to me

Thank  you for being good

SPOKEN WORD:

Bridge


Favor is deceitful  and beauty is vain

but a woman that fears the LORD she shall be praised

Thou excelleth, o mother of Nations

Our abundance of wisdom

God's gift to us all

Words cannot describe what you mean to us, who you are to us

Your laws give us life, they light up our paths

We see better, we see farther, we see like no one else before us

Oh how blessed we are to have you

Oh how dear the words from your lips

Blessings on blessings, Grace upon grace

My mother and I we'll journey for life

Happy birthday Mother
