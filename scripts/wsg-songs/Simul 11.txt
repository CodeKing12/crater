Wonderful, marvellous,
is Jesus to me.

Sweeter than the honey
in the honeycomb is He.

He set me free,
He set me free,

I will praise Him night and day
Throughout eternity.

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus; there's just something about that name.

Master, Savior, Jesus, like the fragrance after the rain;

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, let all Heaven and earth proclaim

Kings and kingdoms will all pass away,

But there's something about that name.

Kings and kingdoms will all pass away,

But there's something about that name.
