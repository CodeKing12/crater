It starts from holy

To hallelujah

And amen

That's the progression

We and the angels in one accord

To the one who reigns on high

Holy holy

Hallelujah

Forever Amen

The fragrance of my worship

Rose up to the father

Noises, thunderings, lightening

Were the response to my worship

First it was fragrance

Then it turned to fire

My worship is my weapon

This is how I take the world

This is how I win win win

This is how I win

The smoke of my worship released

Upon the earth

Eni to ba do ju ko mi
(Anybody that confronts me)

A ba baba mi Nile
(Will meet my father at home)

Eni to ba ro iku kan mi
(Anybody that wishes me dead)

A ba baba mi lejo
(Will have a case with my father)

I get backing oh

I walk with God the Father

Walk with God the Son

I walk with God the Spirit

Three of them join

I get backing oh

I no dey walk alone

Ah ya ah ya ah ay
