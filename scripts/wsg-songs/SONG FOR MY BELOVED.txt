Broken and empty

Tears from my slavery

Jesus you took the cross for me

Now I'm redeemed from sin

Now I'm passed from death to life

All because you paid with your life

And now you've called me

to preach the gospel to everyone

To reign with you and now I see

chorus
Your love is all that I need

Your love is all for me

Your love is my sanctuary

Your love is all for me

tag
Now I'm filled with joy

You give me peace and joy

You fill me with your love

I want more

No, I cannot sleep

I love to be with you

Jesus I love you ooo

Your ascension made available your precious gift

The gift of your precious holy name

chorus
Your name is all that I need

Your name is my Sanctuary

Your name is all that I need

Your name is all for me

chorus
Jesus I am lovesick

And my heart keeps yearning for thee

From the sunrise to the evening

I keep thinking about thee

Jesus saves

Jesus saves

Jesus saves

my Jesus saves

Call his name

Would you call his name, call his name

Jesus saves

Jesus saves

I love you

I love you

B'cos you're everything to me

B'cos you died for my sins
