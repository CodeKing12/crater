I've been waiting on the lord

The lord most high

I've been waiting on my king

He will speak and make my life what I ought to be

He has fashioned in his will

Chorus
I belong to him

I belong to him

He has made my life brand new

I am one with him

I am one with him

He has made my life beautiful

He has made my life his own
