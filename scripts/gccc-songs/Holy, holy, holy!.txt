Holy, holy, holy!
Lord God Almighty
Early in the morning
Our song shall rise to
Holy, holy, holy!
Merciful and mighty
God in three persons
Blessed Trinity!

Holy, holy, holy!
Though the darkness hide
Though the eye of sinful
Thy glory may not see
Only Thou art holy
There is none beside Thee
Perfect in power, in love

Holy, holy, holy!
Lord God Almighty
All Thy works shall praise
In earth and sky and sea
Holy, holy, holy!
Merciful and mighty
God in three persons
Blessed Trinity

God in three persons
Blessed Trinity!
