JUST PRAISE CLAN
MINISTERING
WITH YOU

God of love
God of power

The only reason that I am still here

God of mercy your hand of grace

Touched my life I

Life was so empty until you came in

When I was weak
you showed me your strength

Now I


chorus
With you I find my strength

With you I can hold on

With you I know I

No greater power than you

Nobody's greater than you


BRIDGE
when I


chorus
With you I

With you I can hold on

With you I know I

No greater power than you

Nobody's greater than you
