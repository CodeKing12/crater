MINISTERING
I WIN

VERSE 1
Up in the morning I rise

With a praise in my mouth

And a sword in my hands

Favour released on my life

My faith shall not fail

I

CHORUS
I win, I win, I win, I win

Oh oh I win

Our God be glorified

VERSE 2
Up with my hands I do reign

For his glory

And his works I shall praise

VIC-TO-O-RY we shall see

For his promise to me

I win triumphantly

CHORUS
I win, I win, I win, I win

Oh oh I win

Our God be glorified
