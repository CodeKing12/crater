GLORIOUS DUNAMIS TEENS CHOIR
MINISTERING
LOST

I  will seek you

Until I find you

For the rest of my life

I keep running after you

I

I finally found my place in you

Drifted away

I

Save in your grace

There

I

There is tranquility

Less insecurity

Save in your arm

So glad I found you

The search is over now

I

I found you
