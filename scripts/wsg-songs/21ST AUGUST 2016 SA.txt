PRAISES

Look what you've done for me

Your love has set me free

Jesus my Lord,
Look what you've done for me

What can I do for you, my Lord

I want you to know my heart is yours

It's not a question of what you can do for me

What can I do for you, my Lord

Lord, I come with a song today

Lord, I come with a psalm today

Lord, I come with a tongue today

Lord, I come with a word today

You are,
You are Lord...

You reign,
Lord, You reign...

You are the first, the last,
beginning and the end

In You I live, and move, and have my being

You hold my world, my life, my future all in Your hands

And you knew my name before time begin

There is absolutely nothing You can't do
(You can't do)

And absolutely nothing compares to You

I just want to be more like You

I surrender all, make me more like You

You make all things new

Your love's pure and true

Nothing else could do

I'm in love with you

You are everything
(You are everything)

Everything is you
(Everything is You)

Ate rere ka ri aye
(The sovereign God)

Iwo nikan loba to gba ni
(You are the only God who saves)

He turned it

No more crying days

No more hurt and pain

No more guilt and shame

He turned it

No more loneliness

No more fear and stress

No more sadness

He turned it...
