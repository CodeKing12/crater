She's been sleeping on a bed of stone
By a window where no light goes
She wakes to the roar of the traffic
Rumbling outside
Then she remembers her dream and smiles
Yes she smiles

On her dress she irons the folds
Same way mama told
Her brothers and sisters
All the way home
Are proud of the way she fights
Hardship alone

[Chorus:]
Some hope but they let go
Some hope but they don't know
Which way will the wind blow
What will tomorrow bring
What will tomorrow bring

On her feet from dawn to night
Working jobs others don't like
Sometimes she wonders if
They know that she is there
The way that they talk to her
Look through and stare

Almost all the money she earns
She save's for the day she returns
She goes through left overs
When the market is closed
Without paper she knows the police
Will send her back home

Some hope but they let go
Some hope but they don't know
Which way will the wind blow
What will tomorrow bring

What side of the road will you land on
What end of the card where you passed on
Nobody knows there's no right way
Nobody knows there's no wrong
I bi ay
Oyin lo oyin lo
