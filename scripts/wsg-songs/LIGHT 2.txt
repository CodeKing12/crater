MINISTERING
UNSTOPPABLE GOD

Heaven thundered

And the world was born

Life begins and ends

In the dust You formed

Faith commanded

And the mountains moved

Fear is losing ground

To our hope in You


Unstoppable God

Let Your glory go on and on

Impossible things

In Your name they shall be done...

Unstoppable God

Let Your glory go on and on

Impossible things

In Your name they shall be done...


Freedom conquered

All our chains undone

Sin defeated

Jesus has overcome


Mercy triumphed

When the third day dawned

Darkness was denied

When the stone was gone


Unstoppable God

Let Your glory go on and on

Impossible things

In Your name they shall be done

Unstoppable God

Let Your glory go on and on

Impossible things

In Your name they shall be done...



Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh...



Nothing shall be impossible

Your kingdom reigns unstoppable

We'll shout Your praise forevermore

Jesus our God unstoppable.....



We gotta sing it loud

We gotta shout it out

Cause we know without a doubt

Our God's Unstoppable...



Unstoppable God

Let Your glory go on and on (eh oh eh)

Impossible things

In Your name they shall be done ( eh oh eh).....



Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh...
