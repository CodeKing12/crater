You are Mighty God

Mighty God, Wo ye ye ye oh oh

You are Good, you are kind

You are more than these

I'm lost for Words trying to describe you

Elohim, El-elyon, Aleselewi

Your Greatness is all I see

There is nothing you cannot do

There's no mountain you cannot move

If you have said it
Then you will do it

Cause You have a Track record
Of keeping Words

And you're not about
To stop doing it now

Olorun Agbaye oh,
(You are Mighty oh)

You are mighty o
By the Blood that you shed

We have overcome
Discharged and acquitted for life

Then you gave us the right
To your Holy Name

The center of Power and Strength

There is nothing you cannot Change

There's no bondage you cannot Break

If you have said it
Then you will do it

You have a Track record
Of keeping Words

And you're not about
To stop doing it now

Olorun Agbaye oh,
