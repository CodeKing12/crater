You're deserving of more
I give you more


I wanna give my best to You
I wanna do what You asked me to do
I wanna go wherever you say
Just say the word and I'll obey
I wanna live a life that's real
I wanna serve you Lord for real
Cuz you deserve all this and more
So I give you more


All the worshippers in me wants to be
From the cares of life that seems to
All the worshippers in me needs
To lift my hands and give You praise


All the worshippers in me wants to
from the intellectual mentality
but when i should be up, I'm sitting in
should be lifting up my hands and
Lord, I should be giving you more
