My times are in Thy hand;

My God, I wish them there;

My life, my friends, my soul I leave

Entirely to Thy care.



My times are in Thy hand;

Whatever they may be;

Pleasing or painful, dark or bright,

As best may seem to Thee.



My times are in Thy hand;

Why should I doubt or fear?

My Father

His child a needless tear.



My times are in Thy hand,

Jesus, the crucified!

Those hands my cruel sins had pierced

Are now my guard and guide.



My times are in Thy hand,

Jesus, my Advocate:

Nor shall Thine hand be stretched in vain,

For me to supplicate.



My times are in Thy hand,

I

And, after death, at Thy right hand

I shall forever be.
