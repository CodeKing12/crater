Wo ye ye ye oh oh

You are Mighty God

Mighty God, Wo ye ye ye oh oh

You are Good, you are kind

You are more than these

I'm lost for Words trying to describe you

Elohim, El-elyon, Aleselewi

Your Greatness is all I see

There is nothing you cannot do

There's no mountain you cannot move

If you have said it

Then you will do it

Cause You have a Track record

Of keeping Words

And you're not about

To stop doing it now

By the Blood that you shed

We have overcome

Discharged and acquitted for life

Then you gave us the right

To your Holy Name

The center of Power and Strength

There is nothing you cannot Change

There's no bondage you cannot Break

If you have said it

Then you will do it

You have a Track record

Of keeping Words

And you're not about

To stop doing it now
