I come before the throne of Grace
I come boldly that i may obtain mercy

Mercy Lord Mercy
All we need is your Mercy
so we can find help in time of need

Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
