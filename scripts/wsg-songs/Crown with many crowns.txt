Crown with many crowns, The lamb upon his throne

while heaven's eternal anthem drowns, all music but its own

awake, my soul, and sing, of him who died to be

your saviour and your matchless King, through all eternity...

Crown him Lord of life, triumphant from the grave

who rose victorious from the strife, for those he came to save

his glories now we sing, who died and reigns on high

he died eternal life to bring, and lives that death may die.

Crown him the Lord of peace, his kingdom is at hand

from pole to pole let warfare cease, and Christ rule every land

a city stands on high, his glory it displays

and there the nations, 'Holy' cry, in joyful hymns of praise

Crown him the Lord of years, the potentate of time

creator of the rolling spheres, in majesty sublime

all hail, Redeemer, hail!, For you have died for me

thy praise shall never, never fail, throughout eternity.
