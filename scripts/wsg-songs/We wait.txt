We wait

We're not in a hurry

O we need You Lord

We wait

All our cares and worries

We lay aside for You

O how we long to see Your face

O how we long for Your embrace

We wait

We're not afraid to tarry

We yearn for You Lord

We wait

For Your mighty wind to carry us

Into Your presence Lord

And as we fill this house with praise

May Your holy fire fill this place

As we wait

We wait

We wait

We wait on you

And as we fill this house with praise

May Your holy fire fill this place

As we wait

As we wait

As we wait
