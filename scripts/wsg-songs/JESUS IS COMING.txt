See, this is the truth

Jesus is coming
And it can happen tomorrow, next week or next month or even next year

But let me tell you the biggest thing that I fear.

See I fear, that we push back the growth with our Heavenly father
because sitting down and cracking an old book is such a bother

This will keep us from when he comes again because our relationship
with God isn't real. No,see, it's all just pretence

Now, when we may be what we claim to be, yet some of us has never prayed to
God in our lowest posture, on our hands and on our knees and you may think that I'm being harsh but I'm just been honest

Because if you truly understood what this thing mean
you would follow our Lord and Saviour to the extreme

If you truly understood what this thing meant, you would repent
you would lament, you would represent what it means to be a Christian

And do everything in your power to have one - way ticket, Heaven admission

Now see, the day that Jesus returns
What a glorious day that'll be

When Jesus comes from Heaven to earth to set us free and
I cannot wait to leave it all behind

All of the worry, all of the fear and all of the doubt that
once filled my mind and finally sit in the sit that my name has been assigned

But we can only approach this day with hope instead of fear
Being a Christian is just more than just a title or religion but what we actually appear

Now, I want you to experience what this day will hold
But in order to do that, your faith in God cannot be timid, no, see, it has to be bold

See in I Thessalonians 4:16, it says
the Lord will descend from Heaven t earth and this day will be silent and the trumpet will play

And we hear the sound but we'll not be afraid
But will be surrounded by tens of thousands of Angels

And what a sight that will be and i don't want you to miss this

That there is a war that is waged on your spirit that the enemy is
Trying to distract mankind of having a pure and holy State of mind

And to my brothers and sisters,I want you to be
Prepared for this war and be in seek of God every single day, wanting him more

See, this is the day that we set our hope on
when our brokenness, all of our pains and all of our sin will be finally gone

This is the day we will rise up to meet our Lord
We when we'll be standing face to face with our maker

That will be the greatest reward

This is the day that every knee shall bow and tongue confess that
Jesus is our Lord and our Righteousness

And to those of you that felt like you Never belonged or never mattered
You will finally be in a place with love and perfection will gather

See, this is the day when Jesus takes back what was rightfully ours
And that the enemy is no match to Jesus' nighty power

But see, This day could happen anytime and
I don't want you to be left behind

So, hold on to what is good and stay away from evil
Because when Jesus comes again

This will be the end
