STANDING ON YOUR FAITHFULNES


We've witnessed your power
We've lived in your wonder

But there's still abundantly
More than we've imagined

We've walked in your fire
We know your desire

But there's still abundantly
More than we've imagined

God, You Are Good
Good To Us

And We Are Standing
On Your Faithfulness

You're doing a new thing
You're just beginning

There are still greater things
Yet to be discovered

You're writing our future
You're breathing our story

But there are still greater things
Yet to be discovered

The Glory's Always Been Yours
Forever And Ever

The Glory's Always Been Yours

Our Victory's Always Been Yours
Forever And Ever

Our Victory's Always Been Yours
