WORSHIPPERS

You are good and Your mercy is forever

Halleluyah...

Worthy worthy...
Worthy is the lamb

I've climbed into the highest mountain

Looked all around
Couldn't find nobody

I went down into the deepest valley

Searched all around down there
Couldn't find nobody

I went across the deep blue sea

Couldn't find one to compare

To your grace your love
Your mercy

Nobody greater
Nobody greater than You

Come to praise you oh oh

Come to love you oh oh

Come to praise you

For the good things you have done

Yahweh you are worthy of my praise

Weh eh eh eh
you are worthy of my praise.

Oh oh oh oh...

Worthy of my praise.
