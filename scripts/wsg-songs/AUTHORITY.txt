Chorus
Who no know must to know oh
I am the son of the living God

Authority choke
I'm never alone

Who no know must to know oh
I am the son of the living God

Filled with the spirit
I'm never alone

Verse
He thats joined unto the Lord is one Spirit
One mind

I share this body with the Most High
He got me sitted on high on the throne

Now I'm so high i see the sky like the ground floor
Deputies of the Mighty God

We are kings and Priests to the Lord
Born to rule as the great mountain

And The Holy Nation
The Royal Priesthood

Wielding the sceptre of God
The Gathering of Achievers growing

until shiloh come

Working steady till we take the
world back to the Master Plan

We reign over the Earth, Fulfil His will on Earth
Gon' Dominate until His Kingdom come

Chorus
Who no know must to know oh
I am the son of the living God

Authority choke
I'm never alone

Who no know must to know oh
I am the son of the living God

Filled with the spirit
I'm never alone

Take a look at my life
supernatural lifestyle

The blessings around, favour around, anointing around now

When I step into places
I dey take dominion

The blessings around, favour around, anointing around oh

Verse
Who no know must to know oh
I am the son of the living God

Authority choke
I'm never alone

Who no know must to know oh
I am the son of the living God

Filled with the spirit
I'm never alone

Bridge

Verse
Any time wey we enter
Favour and wisdom dey enter with us

Baba God na my defender
Wahalla for who wan dey drag with us

For my life I no know pain

Really great ful that you came

Baba God u b too much
Before I call u dey pickup

Before I lack u dey provide I don see water before I start dey hiccup


Bridge
I got the blessings on my inside

I got the blessings of God

Nothing is outside

Blessing is inside
(Blessing is inside)

We're done chasing shadows
(We're done chasing shadows)

Nothing is outside
(Nothing is outside)

Blessing is inside
(Blessing is inside)

Favour is inside
(Favour is inside)
