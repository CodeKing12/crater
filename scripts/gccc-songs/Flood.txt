Chorus 1
But if I can't swim
After forty days
And my mind is crushed
By the crashing waves
Lift me up so high
That I cannot fall
Lift me oh woh

Verse 1
Rain rain on my face
Hasn't stopped raining for days
My world is a flood
Slowly I've become one with the mud

Verse 2
Downpour on my soul
Splashing in the ocean
I'm losing control
Dark sky all around
Can't feel my feet
Touching the ground

BRIDGE
Lift me up
When I'm falling
Lift me up
When I'm weak and I'm dying
Lift me up
I need You to hold me
Lift me up
And keep me from drowning again
