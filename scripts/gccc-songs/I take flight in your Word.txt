I take flight in your Word
I take flight in your Spirit
And I ride on eagle's wings
My Jesus gave me wings to fly

Jesus gave me wings to fly
Your word is wings for me to fly
God's grace has got me flying highhhh
Jesus gave me wings to fly

Call: I have my victories in you
Resp:  I have my victories in you
Call: I count my victories in you
Resp:  I count my victories in you
Call: You are my victory O Lord
Resp: You are my victory O Lord
All: Jesus gave me wings to fly
