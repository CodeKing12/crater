All these years I
Then you came along And Light up my world
And all the while I
Then you came along And breathe your breath of life.

Chibundu (God is life)
Chibundu (God is life)
Chibundu (God is life)
I'll tell the world, tell the world
Chibundu.

Now my life has new meaning
Miracles  I
It
Oh oh
Yeah eh eh eh.

New life you gave
New life I have
Oh oh
Yeah eh eh eh.
