verse 1
Jesus is Lord! creation's voice proclaims it,

For by His power each tree and flower

Was planned and made.

Jesus is Lord! the universe declares it,

Sun, moon and stars in heaven, Cry, 'Jesus is Lord!'

chorus
Jesus is Lord!  Jesus is Lord! Praise Him with Hallelujahs

For Jesus is Lord!

verse 2
Jesus is Lord! yet from His throne eternal

In flesh He came to die in pain on Calvary's tree.

Jesus is Lord! from Him all life proceeding,

Yet gave His life a ransom thus setting us free.

chorus
Jesus is Lord!  Jesus is Lord!
Praise Him with Hallelujahs

For Jesus is Lord!

verse 3
Jesus is Lord! o'er sin the mighty conqueror,

From death He rose, and all His foes Shall own His Name.

Jesus is Lord!  God sent His Holy Spirit

To show by works of power That Jesus is Lord.

chorus
Jesus is Lord!  Jesus is Lord!
Praise Him with Hallelujahs

For Jesus is Lord!
