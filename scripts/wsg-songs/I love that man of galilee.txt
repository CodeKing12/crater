I love that man of galilee

For he has done so  very much for me

He has forgiven me all my sins

and sent the holyghost to me

I love the man of galilee




I am glad,so glad

I am glad to be a servant of the lord

He taught me how to serve him he taught me how to sing a song

He taugh me how to love

I am glad to be a servant of the lord
