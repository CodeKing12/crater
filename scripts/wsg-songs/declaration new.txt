My experiences are Divine

I do strong things

I manifest because I am a son of God

I am in the favour part of everything

What is impossible for the world is my own possibility.

When people are complaining, I am rejoicing .

I am calm through the process God is taking me through.

I am not a movement.

I am not small

I am so great because my God is so great

My cities shall spread through prosperity.

I have the mind of prosperity

I do the things prosperity can do.

In this season, I have more, I give more.

I have the results prosperity produces

I will never be ashamed.

Because God has blessed me, I am really blessed

Yea I am blessed

Glory to God in my life

Glory to God in my prosperity

Glory to God in my blessing.

Hallelujah.
