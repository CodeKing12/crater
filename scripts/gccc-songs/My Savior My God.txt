I am not skilled to understand
What God has willed what God has planned
I only know at His right hand
Stands One who is my Savior

Christ died to save me this I read
And in my heart I find a need
Of Him to be my Savior

BRIDGE
That He would leave His place on high
And come for sinful man to die
You count it strange so once did I
Before I knew my Savior

Verse 3
Yes living dying let me bring
My strength my solace from this spring
That He who lives to be my King
Once died to be my Savior
