SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

Great is your mercy towards me

Your loving kindness towards me

Your tender mercy I see

Day after day

Forever faithful towards me

Always providing for me

Great is your mercy towards me

Great is your grace


You are my father

You are my future, my destiny

You are my father

In you I find my identity

In you I find my identity


Laid your hands on me

Told me who I am

I can do all things

'Cos  you said I can

Shown me I am free

Free to accomplish your plans for me
