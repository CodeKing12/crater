SOLDIERS FOR CHRIST
MINISTERING
EBEZINA

is the same God
who was there for you in the mid night hour

is the same God
who is able to wipe your tears away

is the same God
who was there in times of lack and want

is the same God my great provider

tell me why you've given up on God

tell me why you've given up on him

tell me why you've given up on God

hold on change is on the way
