Crown with many crowns

Crown with many crowns

The lamb upon his throne

While heaven's eternal anthem drowns

All music but its own

Awake, my soul, and sing

Of him who died to be

Your saviour and your matchless King

Through all eternity.

Crown him Lord of life

Triumphant from the grave

Who rose victorious from the strife

For those he came to save

His glories now we sing

Who died and reigns on high

He died eternal life to bring

And lives that death may die.

Crown him the Lord of peace

His kingdom is at hand

From pole to pole let warfare cease

And Christ rule every land

A city stands on high

His glory it displays

And there the nations, 'Holy' cry

In joyful hymns of praise

Crown him the lord of years

The potentate of time

Creator of the rolling spheres

In majesty sublime

All hail, Redeemer, hail!

For you have died for me

Thy praise shall never, never fail

Throughout eternity.
