Verse
When all I see is the battle, You see my victory

When all I see is the mountain, You see a mountain moved

And as I walk through the shadow, Your love surrounds me

There's nothing to fear now for I am safe with You

Verse
So when I fight, I'll fight on my knees

With my hands lifted high,

Oh God, the battle belongs to You

And every fear I lay at Your feet I'll sing through the night

Oh God, the battle belongs to You

Verse
And if You are for me, who can be against me?

Yeah, For Jesus, there's nothing impossible for You

When all I see are the ashes, You see the beauty

Thank You God

When all I see is a cross, God, You see the empty tomb

Verse
So when I fight, I'll fight on my knees

With my hands lifted high Oh God,

the battle belongs to You

And every fear I lay at Your feet I'll sing through the night Oh God,

the battle belongs to You

Verse
Almighty fortress, You go before us

Nothing can stand against the power of our God

You shine in the shadow,

You win every battle

Nothing can stand against the power of our God

An almighty fortress, You go before us

Nothing can stand against the power of our God

You shine in the shadow,

You win every battle Nothing can stand against the power of our God

An almighty fortress,

You go before us Nothing can stand against the power of our God

You shine in the shadows, You win every battle

Nothing can stand against the power of our God

So when I fight, I'll fight on my knees

With my hands lifted high

Oh God, the battle belongs to You

And every fear I lay at Your feet I'll sing through the night

Oh God, the battle belongs to You
