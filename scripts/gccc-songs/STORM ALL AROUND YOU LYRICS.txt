I know there are creatures all around
I know there are lightenings and
I know there's a storm all around You
Holy, Holy, Holy

I see seven lamps of fire burning
I see a sea of glass mingled with fire
I see the Son of Man with eyes of fire
Burning, burning, burning

Halle- Halle- Hallelujah
For the Lord God omnipotent reigns

Everyone in the temple cries holy

Give us the fear of the Lord that we

The Lord is in His temple
Let all flesh tremble
