My great Redeemer's praise,
The glories of my God and King,
The triumphs of His grace!

Assist me to proclaim,
To spread through all the earth abroad,
The honors of Thy name.

That bids our sorrows cease;

'Tis life, and health, and peace.

His blood can make the foulest clean;
His blood availed for me.

thy will would e'er be mine.

my Lord, they all were Thine!
