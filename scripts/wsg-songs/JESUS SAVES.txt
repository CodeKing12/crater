JESUS SAVES

Jesus Saves

From the cross

To the grave

Jesus saves

From the cross

To the grave

Jesus saves

You died for me

The ultimate sacrifice

Just for me

Whom you had never seen

So my voice I will raise

Testify that

Jesus saves

From the cross

To the grave

Jesus saves

You saved my life

To the grave

You raised me up

And Your resurrection power

Saved me from the sting of death

Jesus saves...

I'm a living witness that He does

He can save you from death too

From the sting of rejection and pain

From the bondage of depression He will

Oh I'm a living witness that He does

Oh yes He does

For the bible said

If I be lifted up

I

If I be lifted up

I

He

Yes he

Somebody reach out for it

He

Sin has no weight

That the glory cannot handle

Jesus saves
