ADORATION

Adoration be to the highest king
With wisdom and power he speaks

In all the Earth, there is none like him
Humble yourself, bow before him

The Lord is great, In Zion Let his praises ring
With a joyful noise, his praise we sing.

Yes, The Lord is merciful and gracious
His love endureth forever more

Bless the Lord, O my soul
Honour and majesty to the king of Kings

All   power and Glory to him  be
His Kingdom is forevermore

Let us bow down before him and Worship him

Behold, his Kingdom is here, Everlasting.
Behold, here we his elect are Worshipping him.
