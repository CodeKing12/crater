If there be anything
That hinders me from You
Take it away, take it away

If there be anything
That hinders my worship
Take it away, take it away

Take my doubts away
Take my fears away
Take my past away
Purify my heart

So I can worship
So I can worship
So I can worship
So I can worship
You are my king
