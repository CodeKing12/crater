I thank thee oh Father

Lord of heaven and earth

The Lord, the Lord God

Merciful and gracious

Long suffering and abundant in goodness

And in truth

Keeping mercy for thousands

Forgiving iniquities and trangressions and sins

And that will by no means clear the guilty

Visiting the inquities of the fathers upon the children

And upon the children's children

Unto the third, and to the fourth generation

For the lord is good and His mercy and love endureth forever

Thou art the mighty god

Blessed be the name of THE Lord God OUR FATHER

Blessed be the name of THE Lord God of the nations

Blessed be the name of THE Lord God OF ISRAEL

Blessed be the name of THE Lord God OUR FATHER

Blessed be the name of THE Lord

Blessed be...
