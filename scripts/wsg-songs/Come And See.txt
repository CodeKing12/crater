COME AND SEE

TAG
So True

Just Because of Me He Died

Faithful

Savior Sent to all Mankind

Such Love

Has no other Name than This

To Lay Down His Life

For the One He

I Cannot Hold Back

His Love To Myself.


Chorus
Come And See

What The Lord

Has Done for Me

He has taken away my Pain

He has taken away my Shame

Oh Oh Ooh.

TAG
New Life He gave to me

When He hung on Calvary

I was Lost, Yet He found me

I can not tell you

(Come And See).

TAG
He brought me out

From the Miry Clay

Set my feet on the Rock to stand

He healed my Father

I tell you, come and see

All Come And See

You are new

Old things are gone

He gave you life, He gave you Breath

He gave you His Love,

And He gave you everything

I tell you say

All Come And See

Old things are passed away

The new is here, The new is here

The new is here, The new is here

Ooh say

(Come And See)
