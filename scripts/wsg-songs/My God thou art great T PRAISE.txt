My God thou art great

Thou art great

You're the greatest

Great is the Lord

And greatly to be praise

In the city of our God

In the mountain of his Holiness

Beautiful for situations

The Joy of the whole earth

Is mount Zion

Sides of the north

The city of the great king

Is mount Zion

Sides of the north

the city of the great king

My God thou art great

Thou art great

You're the greatest
