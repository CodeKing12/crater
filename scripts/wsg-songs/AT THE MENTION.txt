SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

At the mention of your name

Every knee shall bow

At the mention of your name

Every tongue confess

At the mention of your name

Every knee shall bow

At the mention of your name

Every tongue confess

He is Lord

Hallelujah glory to God

With you our lives are changed forever

With you our lives are changed

With you our lives are changed forever and ever

Every hands in this room should be lifted

For what he has done

If we had ten thousand hands

We couldn't raise them enough

Every voice in this place should be raised

Giving God praise

If we had one million voices

We couldn't raise them enough

He had to pay the price to give us life

And with all that's within

We owe this praise to him

We owe this praise

Owe this praise

There is lighting and thunder

Lighting and thunder

Miracles and wonders

Sound of many waters

Heaven on earth

We owe this praise
