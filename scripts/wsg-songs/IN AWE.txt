IN AWE

Verse 1
All the heavens reveal your Glory

all the earth tremble at your feet

at your sound everything obey

as we stand in awe of you

Chorus
In awe, in awe of you

I stand in awe of you

Verse 2
of your word, you change us forever

of your blood, you washed us clean

of your reign, you made us just like you

and we are one with you

chorus
In awe, in awe of you

I stand in awe of you

Vamp:
Great is your name

Oh great is your power

great is your word

that change us forever

As we bow and in awe of your holy name

Lord our hearts sing praises to your holy name
