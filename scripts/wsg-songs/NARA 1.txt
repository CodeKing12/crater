You've done so much for me

If I have ten thousand tongues

It still won't be enough

When you heal

You heal completely

(Receive my praise)

Chukwu ma robi mo
(Lord you know my heart)

Isi ikendule
(All powerful you are)

Nara ekele mo
(Receive my praise)

What shall I render to Jehovah

For he has done so very much for me

(Receive my praise)

Nara ekele mo
(Receive my praise)

Ebighebi ruo na ebigbebi

Ancient of days

You never ever change

(You do not Change)

From Age to Age Lord

You remain the same

I dighi agbanwe agbanwe
(You do not Change)
