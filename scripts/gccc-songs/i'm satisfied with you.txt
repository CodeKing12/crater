I'll put you in front

you are all that matters
you are all that matters(2x)
i am satisfied with you

i am satisfied with you
You are all that matters

I will go with you Lord
You are all that matters

you are all that matters
i am satisfied with you
you are all that matters

I'll put you in front
In front of my melody
You're all that matters
You're all that matters

I'll make room for you
You only Jesus
You're all that matters
You're all that matters

Owei, owei
You're all that matters
Owei, owei
You're all that matters
