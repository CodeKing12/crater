Only a fool will look into the heaven

and say there is no God

Only a mad man will look into the sea

and say that the fishes are a mistake

Even the babalawo can testify

that there is only one Jehovah

So who are you to tell me that

my Yahweh my Jehovah doesn't exist

He's a consuming fire o

Lion of the tribe of Judah

Him alone shall I serve o

for the rest of my days
