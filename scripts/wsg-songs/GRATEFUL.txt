GRATEFUL

God has not promised me sunshine

That's not the way it's going to be

But a little rain (A little rain)

Mixed with God's sunshine

A little pain (A little pain)

Makes me appreciate the good times

(Be-e-e-e-e-e Grateful) Grateful

(Be-e-e-e-e-e Grateful) Grateful

Don

Every pain that you feel

He feels them just like you (Just like you)

But he can't afford to let you feel only good (Only good)

Then you can appreciate the good times

(Be-e-e-e-e-e Grateful)
