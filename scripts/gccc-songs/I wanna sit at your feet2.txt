I wanna sit at your feet
Drink from the cup in
Lay back against you
This love is so deep,
I melt in your peace,

I want to sit at your
Drink from the cup in
Lay back against you
This love is so real, it's
I melt in your peace,

I melt in your peace,

The more I seek you
The more I find you
The more I find you,
the more I love you
