PRAISE MY SOUL THE KING OF HEAVEn

Praise my soul the King of heaven, To His feet your tribute bring

Ransomed healed restored forgiven, Evermore His praises sing

Praise Him Praise Him, Praise the everlasting King

Praise Him for His grace and favor, To His people in distress

Praise Him still the same forever, Slow to chide and swift to bless

Praise Him Praise Him, Glorious in His faithfulness

Father-like He tends and spares us, Well our feeble frame He knows

In His hands He gently bears us, Rescues us from all our foes

Praise Him Praise Him, Widely as His mercy flows

verse
Angels in the height adore Him! You behold Him face to face;

Saints triumphant bow before Him! Gathered in from every race

Praise Him, Praise with us the God of grace!

Praise Him, Praise the everlasting King
