MINISTERING
SHACKLES OFF MY FEET

Chorus
Shook the shackles off my feet so I can dance

I just wanna praise you,
I just wanna praise you

You broke the chain so I can lift my hands

And I'm gonna praise you,
and I'm gonna praise you

Verse 1
In the corners of my mind

I just can't seem to find a reason to believe that I can break free

Cause you see I have been down for so long feel like all hope is gone

But as I lift my hands I understand that

I should praise you through my everything

Chorus
Shook the shackles off my feet so I can dance

I just wanna praise you,
I just wanna praise you

You broke the chain so I can lift my hands

And I'm gonna praise you, and I'm gonna praise you

Verse 2
Now that I'm walking in the light

There's no darkness

Now that I've found Joy and peace

There's no sadness

He took away the pain

No longer am I the same

And he robed me in white

And he changed my name

That's what he's done for me

That's what he's done for me

Change change change

He changed my life..

Verse 3
Our God is an awesome God he reigns

From heaven above with wisdom power and love

Our God is an awesome God


You're marvelous and you're glorious

Your love has made me victorious

He took away the fear in us

Now we praise him cause he's delivered us


There ain't no stopping us
(Now)

The devil ain't no blocking us
(Now)

Common now clap your hands with us

Our God is an awesome God he reigns

From heaven above with wisdom power and love

Our God is an awesome God
