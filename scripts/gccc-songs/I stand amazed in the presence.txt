I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene,
And wonder how He could love me,
A sinner condemned, unclean

CHORUS
Oh how marvelous! Oh how wonderful!
And my song shall ever be:
Oh how marvelous! Oh how wonderful!
Is my Savior

For me it was in the garden,
He prayed:
He had no tears for His own griefs,
But sweat-drops of blood for mine.

In pity angels beheld Him,
And came from the world of light
To comfort Him in the sorrows
He bore for my soul that night.

He took my sins and my sorrows,
He made them His very own;
He bore the burden to Calv
And suffered, and died alone.

When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see,
â€™
To sing of His love for me.
