OYoyo yo

Nothing can separate me from your love.

No be lie, na only you wey change my life

Your love is unspeakable
Blessings are uncountable

Everything that you do
lord i cannot tell it all

Let me count 12345678

Iyoyo okaka
Inimo werem mo odinma

God and God alone
Let your name be glorified

King of kings
lord of lords you are

The lion and the lamb
you are

Let your name be glorified
the lily of the valley

Am gonna dance for you
owo mi loke yaya

Your love is unspeakable
Your love is unspeakable

Blessings are uncountable

Everything that you do

Let me count 12345678

Iyoyo okaka
Inimo werem mo odinma

Lord of lords you dey make me wonder
