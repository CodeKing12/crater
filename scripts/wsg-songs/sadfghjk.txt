Yes!

Always remember that He has forgiven

you and has forgotten about it.

And so whatever it is has no hold over you again.

So stop playing P.A for God

By trying to always remind Him.

For he has forgotten!

Therefore if any man be in Christ,

He is a new creature

Old things are passed away

And all things are become new.

New!

That's who you are now!

New!

That who you have become.

So pick up your pen

And let's write this story all over again

Cause it's a new page

A new you!

PAUSE

This story made sense to my ear

that it brought me to my knees.

Tears flowing everywhere as much

as the sins I committed with my hands.

Then I looked at my both hands trembling,

chains and shackles falling off cautiously.

Then I came to my real sense

that became the testimony of my turning.

I turned swiftly to the direction

my Maker wanted me to face,

I became sober then I thought about the wasted years.

Oh what a great waste!

The thought of the man that died

swallowed my pride as I began

learning and meditating .

The man of Galilee,

the Savior of the world,

those Names melted every pain felt.

my pride then switched to Joy,

that Joy was of the host,

from the man of Galilee

Nevertheless the one that roams looking for whom to

destroy came to sow a seed of Sadness to

the sweet Joy that the man of Galilee gave me..

The sweet joy that comes from within my soul

Strongly within me, I knew what I wanted,

so I ran as far as my legs could carry me

Because this new life I have,

nothing can take Him from me

I have found Christ

I have found salvation


Eternity is sure because I am new


Hallelujah
