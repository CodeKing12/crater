SEASONS

The Owner of the World is a Farmer

The Greatest one at that,

Think about it !

Look around and see his divers plantation;

From the fearful heights of MoAuntains

To the tinniest bit of Ants and Sand

Down to You and I

Everything is an expression of his plantation.

To everything in time

There's a Season to it

That's how God arranged it!

In the race of men

I have seen Farmers

Who planted with expectation of Harvest

But No!

Some were in haste to reap

When it's not the time for it

And So, They Quit!

I also know a Pregnant Woman

Nine Month seems too far for her

So there arose a conflict within her soul

Should I just get rid of this?

She asked!

I have  also seen many Athletes of the World

Who have the expectation to win a Race

But many won't train themselves for the prize of it !

How?

Seasons!

Listen!

God is Speaking!

It is a great time Full of Visions In the Spirit

Can you See It?

The Clock of the Spirit is Ticking

Faster than the Human Mind can imagine

Put on the eye salves of the Spirit

So you can See Indeed

There is a Glory Coming

The Harvest is Here

The Maker of All waits for the precious Fruits of the Earth.

And we are His Worker

Word Sanctuary

It's our New Season, Saith The Lord

It's A Season of Power

A Season of Abundance, Increase and Productivity

It is our Season of Pressing

A Season of Answered prayers

God planned it and Finished It

Know It! See It! Believe It,  Act It!

God is in Charge .
