All these years I
Then you came along
And you Light up my world
And all the while I
Then you came along
And you breathe your breath

Chibundu (God is life)
Chibundu (God is life)
Chibundu (God is life)
I'll tell the world, tell the
Chibundu.

Now my life has new
Miracles I
Oh oh
Yeah eh eh eh.

New life you gave
New life I have
Oh oh
Yeah eh eh eh.
