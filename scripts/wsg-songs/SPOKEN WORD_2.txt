VERSE
Holy Holy, Lord almighty

It's a privilege to worship you

Maker of all universe

It's an honor just to stand before you

With a grateful heart I lift my hands to you

Proclaiming Lord you reign....

Father you reign

Great are you Lord

Greatly to be praised

TAG
How can one describe you without reducing you.

I am breathless at thought of all you have made.

The excellency of your wisdom and power is impossible.

My happiness is unchecked

as I unravel the mysteries of your Word.

You are too obvious,

how would one in his right mind deny your presence.

Beyond feelings, beyond imaginations,

beyond mirage, beyond delusions.

You're Substance.

Day and Night my soul hold you close.

All my life I will praise and adore.

You are superior to all my desires.

The move of you Spirit,

the stirring of the passion of my soul,

like winds stirring the deep sea.

Your eyes shines with a fantastic light,

filling me with eternal dreams.

This beauty is incomprehensible

This Grace is inexpressible

This life is inexhaustible.

Its a privilege just to behold you.

VERSE
Father you reign

Great are you Lord

Greatly to be praised

VERSE
If he dresses the lilies with beauty and splendor

How much more will He clothe you

If He watches over, every sparrow

How much more does He love you

TAG
And why are you anxious of clothing?

Consider the lilies of the field how they grow

They neither toil nor spin.

Yet I tell you, even Solomon

in all his glory was not arrayed as one of these.

And if God cares so wonderfully for wild flowers,

That are here today and thrown into the fire tomorrow

He will certainly care for you.

If God gives such attention

to the appearance of the wild flowers,

Most of which are never even seen.

Don't you think he will attend to you?

take your pride, and do His best for you?

What I'm trying to do here

is to get you to relax

Don't be so preoccupied with getting.....

Also respond to God's giving

Stick your life in God's reality,

God's initiative and God's provision

By doing this you'll find all

your everyday human concern will be met

So seek the kingdom of God above all else

and live righteously

and he will give you everything you need

Do you know you're already loved, you're already choosen

Do you know who you are

And do you know what he has spoken

VERSE
If he dresses the lilies with beauty and splendor

How much more will He clothe you

If He watches over, every sparrow

How much more does He love you

I'm already loved

I'm already choosen

I know who I am

I know what you've spoken

I'm already loved

More than I could imagine

And that Is enough
