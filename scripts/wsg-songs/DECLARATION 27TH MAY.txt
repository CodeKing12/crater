I am a priest and a king

I am anointed

I do things well

I excel in all I do

I break limits always,

I am creating history

I am operating the biblical principles of success

I receive provision for my vision

I operate the due order of God

my destiny is duly ordered

I receive endorsement for my life

my incense is accepted

the lifting of my hands are accepted

I have acceptance

I have wisdom

my hands, prosper

my business, prosper

my family, prosper

my academics, prosper

my vision, prosper

my ministry, prosper

my mind, prosper

my life, prosper

all I do, all I see, all I say, where I go....I prosper!
