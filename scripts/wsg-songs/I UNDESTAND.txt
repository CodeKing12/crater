By your blood I was set Free

By your word I was established

For your will, you made me

Sanctified, consecrated unto you
Unto you

I understand who I am in you (In you)

All that I do I do it for you

Put my hand on the plough I'm never looking back

There's nothing else I'Il rather

noting else I'll rather do but to be in
ur presence lord in your prescense lord

By your blood I was set Free

By your word I was established

For your you will, you made me

Sanctified, consecrated unto you
Unto you

I understand who I am in you (In you)

I  know your will, I know your way

You taught me to live  in your holy place

I made free by your word of Grace

Your words everyday......... is what I breathe

I understand who I am in you (in you)
