Break down the walls
Push back the dark

Light of the world
Move in our hearts

There's a stirring in the spirit
Heaven

Something holy, can You feel it?
Heaven

Let Your majesty and worth

Flood the earth


Let the rumors of Your kingdom
Let Your name without reserve

Darkness retreat

Every heart here finding healing

Let Your name without reserve

Flood the earth
