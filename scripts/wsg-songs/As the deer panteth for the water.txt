As the deer panteth for the water

So my soul longeth after you

You alone are my heart's desire

And I long to worship you

You're my friend and you are my brother

Even though you are a king

I love you more than any other

So much more than anything

I want you more than gold or silver

Only you can satisfy

You alone are the joy giver

and the apple of my eyes

You alone are my strength, my shield

To you alone let my spirit yield

You alone are my heart's desire

And I long to worship you
