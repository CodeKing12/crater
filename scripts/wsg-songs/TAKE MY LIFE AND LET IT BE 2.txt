verse 1
Take my life, and let it be
Consecrated, Lord, to Thee,
Take my moments and my days;
Let them flow in ceaseless praise.

VERSE 2
Take my voice, and let me preach
Always, only for my King,
Take my lips, and let them be
Filled with messages from Thee.

VERSE 3
Take my silver and my gold;
Not a mite would I withhold,
Take my intellect, and use
Every pow'r as Thou shalt choose.

VERSE 4
Take my will, and make it Thine,
It shall be no longer mine,
Take my heart
It shall be Thy royal throne.

VERSE 5
Take my love; my Lord, I pour
At Thy feet its treasure-store
Take myself, and I will be
Ever, only, all for thee
