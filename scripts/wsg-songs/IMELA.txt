MINISTERING
IMELA

When I was in sin,
You brought me out

You gave me a new life,
And made me heir

Words ain

Feelings ain

Thank you Lord, for the gift of Jesus your son

You changed me, gave me a life to live

In you I found love, peace and joy

Sin brought death, you offered life

I

'Cause that

Thank you Lord, for the gift of Jesus your son

You changed me, gave me a life to live
