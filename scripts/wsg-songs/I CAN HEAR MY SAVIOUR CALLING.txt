I CAN HEAR MY SAVIOUR CALLING

VERSE 1
I can hear my Saviour calling,
I can hear my Saviour calling,
I can hear my Saviour calling,
Take thy cross, and follow, follow me.

Chorus
Where He leads me I will follow,
Where He leads me I will follow,
Where He leads me I will follow,
I'll go with Him with Him, all the way.

VERSE 2
I will go with Him forever
I will go with Him forever
I will go with Him forever
I'll go with Him, with Him, all the way.

VERSE 3
He's given me grace and glory
He's given me grace and glory
He's given me grace and glory
All go with me, with me, all the way
