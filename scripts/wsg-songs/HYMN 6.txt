Behold, the mountain of the Lord

Behold, the mountain of the Lord
In latter days shall rise
On mountain tops, above the hills,
And draw the wondering eyes

The beam that shine from Zion's hill
Shall lighten every land;
The King who reigns in Salem's tower
Shall all the world command.


Among the nations he   shall judge;
His judgments truth shall guide,
His scepter shall protect the just,
And quell the sinner's pride.


No strife nor rage, nor hostile feuds
Disturb the peaceful years;
To ploughshares soon they beat their swords
To pruning hooks their spears.


Come, then, O house of Jacob, come,
And lift up Jesus Christ
And, walking in the light of God,
Throughout the nations shine
