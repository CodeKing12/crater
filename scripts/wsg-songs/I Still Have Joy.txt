I Still Have Joy


I've been tested
My faith has been tried
Satain has attempted to destroy my life
He's robbed abused accused and stole
He's done everything he could do
To conquer my soul

I still have joy
I still have joy
After all I've been through
I still have joy

Friends have left me
They've questioned my faith
The good I tried to do
Was thrown back in my face
The hurt and the pain brought tears to my eyes
But God has replaced a blessing
For every tear that I've cried

I still have peace
I still have peace
After all I've been through
I still have peace

I still have His love
I still have His love
After all I've been through
I still have His love

After all I've been through
After all I've been through
I still have joy

After all I've been through
