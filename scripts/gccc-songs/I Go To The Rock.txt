Chorus 1
I go to the Rock of my salvation
Go to the Stone
That the builder rejected
Run to the Mountain
And the Mountain stands by me
The earth all around me is sinking sand
On Christ the solid Rock I stand
When I need a shelter
When I need a friend
I go to the Rock

Verse 1
Where do I go
When there's no one else to turn to
Who do I talk to
When no one wants to listen
Who do I lean on
When there's no foundation stable
I go to the Rock I know that's able
I go to the Rock

Verse 2
Where do I hide
'Til the storms have all passed over
Where do I run to
When the winds of sorrow threaten
Is there a refuge
In the time of tribulation
When my soul needs consolation
I go to the Rock
