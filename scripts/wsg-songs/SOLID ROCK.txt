I've found the finished work of Christ

Lift up your holy hands

VERSE1
Your perfect love is casting out fear in me

I'm in a hollow, the hollow of your hands

No guilt in life, no fear in death

It's the power of Christ in me

No guilt in life, no fear in death

It's the power of Christ in me

I'm standing on the solid rock

His name is Jesus

I'm standing on the solid rock

His name is Jesus

CHORUS
He did not fail, I cannot fail

His name is Jesus

I'm standing on the solid rock

His name is Jesus

VERSE2
Oh, by my God
I run through a troop

Oh, by my God
I leap over walls

No shaking, no drying

I stand unmoved
I stand unshakable

I'm not tired

Anchored in the solid rock

No shaking (no shaking),

No drying (no drying)

I stand unmoved

Secured in the Father's hands

I am rooted in the solid rock

Chorus
I'm standing on the solid rock

His name is Jesus

He did not fail, I cannot fail

His name is Jesus

VERSE3
Rain Came

Storm Came

Flood Came

Against that house

I am that house

The house of God

Founded on the rock

The rock is Christ

He did not fail, I cannot fail

His name is Jesus, His name is Jesus
