Jesus is coming
Receive the life of Christ

There is no higher life
There is no greater life than in Jesus

A head full of information
Hand full of money without Jesus

Is an empty life
Only them that believe in Jesus

Have eternal life
Receive Jesus today

Jesus is coming...

He's coming again
Glory be to God


I rejoice, I am so glad
That Man that gave His all for me is coming back

Let everyone hear
Let every heart rejoice

That Man who gave His all for you is coming back
Olilanya Nke ndinso

The resurrection and the life

That Man that gave His all for me is coming back
Mighty Jesus

HHe's coming again
Glory be to God

Mighty Jesus

He's coming again
Glory be to God

I have hope of eternal life
That Man that gave His all for me is coming

My bridegroom cometh
The One who owns my life

I say that Man who gave His all for me is coming back
We will be transformed in the twinkling of an eye

That Man who gave His all for me is coming back

Let everyone hear
Let every heart rejoice

That Man who gave His all... eh, mighty Jesus

He's coming again
Glory be to God

My redeemer
