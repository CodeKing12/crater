You spoke your word

It came to be

Creation speaks of your goodness

For what you say will come to pass

And your word won't return void

Your word is full of grace and truth

And your word is spirit and life.

Your word is true

Your word is you

Your word is everlasting Lord

For what you say will come to pass

And your word won't return void

Your word is full of grace and truth

And your word is spirit and life.

Thy word is a lamp unto my feet

Thy word is a light unto my path

You're my Meditation

You're my Revelation

King of life

Word of life.

You're my meditation (6ce)
