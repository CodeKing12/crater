VERSE
Holy, holy is the Lord

King of everything

The Lord God Almighty

Eternal and sovereign

His name is known

He is forever adored

CHORUS
Holy, holy is the Lord

The Lord God Almighty,

Who was and is to come

BRIDGE
In reverence, we bow down before the throne

Our hearts resound With every breath, We'll sing

We'll sing Holy, holy, holy

Is the Lord of all the Earth
