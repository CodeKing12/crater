In the outset, before the breath of life touched dust,
There was the Creator, infinite, boundless and just.
Beyond the cosmos, in the silence so profound,
Lies the essence of divinity, where true wonder is found.

From the void, He spoke, and light pierced the night,
Stars were ignited, each burning so bright.
Galaxies swirled in a dance so grand,
Crafted by the omnipotent hand.

Time itself bends to His will,
In the vastness of eternity, His presence is still.
He paints the dawn with hues of grace,
And scatters the stars across endless space.

Mountains rise at His command,
Oceans are cupped within His hand.
The whispering winds, the thunder
All echo the power of the One we adore.

In the heart of the storm, He remains serene,
A majestic power, unseen, supreme.
His wisdom transcends all mortal thought,
Every mystery, by Him, is wrought.

Infinite and boundless, You reign supreme
A vast expanse of glory, beyond human dream
Your greatness knows no limits, Your power untold
A mystery that's hidden, yet revealed to the bold

In Your presence, we're humbled, our spirits laid low
Awe-struck by Your grandeur, our hearts aglow
Your love is endless, Your mercy vast
An overwhelming grace, a peace that will last

You're the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end
A circle of perfection, that has no end
Your divinity is vast, a never-ending sea
A treasure trove of wonders, waiting to be set free

In moments of silence, in whispers of prayer,
One feels His presence, tender and fair.
The tapestry of life, woven with care,
Is but a reflection of His divine glare.

Yet in His vastness, He knows each name,
Each heart
His love encompasses, His grace prevails,
In the journey of life, His truth unveils.

(PAUSE FOR A MINUTE)

Oh, the vastness of divinity, beyond our finite gaze,
In awe and wonder, we offer our praise.
In Your vastness, we find our home
A place of refuge, where we are never alone

Oh, vast and mighty God, we worship You in awe
A heartfelt reverence, a praise that's pure
May our lives be a reflection, of Your greatness and might
A shining testimony, to Your vast and wondrous light.

(Starts to Minister to the LORD)

We thank thee oh Father
LORD of heaven and the earth,
For you are The LORD, The LORD God,
Merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth,
Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin,
And that will by no means clear [the guilty]; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth [generation].
For our LORD you are good and your love and Mercy endureth forever
For our LORD you are good and your love and Mercy endureth forever
For our LORD you are good and your love and Mercy endureth forever

Thou art the mighty GOD
Thou art the mighty GOD
Thou art the mighty GOD

Blessed be the LORD GOD of Israel
Blessed be the LORD GOD of our Fathers
Blessed be the LORD GOD of the nations
Blessed be the LORD GOD of Word Sanctuary
Blessed be the LORD MY GOD
Thou oh LORD ART VERY GREAT
