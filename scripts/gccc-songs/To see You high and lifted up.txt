Open the eyes of my heart, Lord
Open the eyes of my heart
I want to see You
I want to see You

We want to see you
We want to see you

To see You high and lifted up
Shinin' in the light of Your glory
Pour out Your power and love
As we sing holy, holy, holy
i want to see you

Holy, holy, holy
Holy, holy, holy
i want to see you

i want to see you
i want to see you
