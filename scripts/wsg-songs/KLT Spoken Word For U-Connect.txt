I thought I was little

I thought I was young

Stakeholders of the Kingdom;

How could I have been one?

I was raised in this Kingdom

Right from my tender age

I was taught the Oracles of Greatness

in the Kingdom of God most high,

And the Teachings of leadership became

the alarm that constantly rings in my ears

You are a King! it says.. You are a Priest! it teaches,

But guess what? I was a CHILD

TAG
An heir didn't even know where they belong

How long will they last in the Jungle?

If you as a child of God didn't know who you are

You'll be lost, you'll be drowned

in a dungeon that isn't even real

TAG
Day by day, I  watched others from afar

rise up in the Kingdom of my Father,

My father's arm is after all open to all.

But I kept wondering what the difference was

Oh!  I thought I was young and unneeded .

TAG
Am I more than this Am I

Am I more than this Am I

TAG
I never knew there is so much power in my vains

as a child raised up in God,

But my Father's voice, God's voice,The Great still

voice keeps screaming out gently in my subconscious

Yes ! God's voice came to me and he said Hey child! rise up

You are a Stakeholder  in this Kingdom, Don't you get it?

You were raised in my bowels and I have waited so long for you,

For an heir, As long as he's a child differeth not from a slave

You are More than a Mere Christian

You are beyond  a natural Man

Your are a King and A Priest unto God

And your Victory has been scheduled

You've been Blessed for this

Shodden with instructions , Laced with revelations

TAG
You are more than this You Are

You are More than this you Are

TAG
So it is Dawn on me that this slavery am into isn't even real,

Am a child of God raised up by ever flowing river of his words of Grace,

But I deprived myself of all the benefits not understanding who I Ma..

It's Time! Rise Up , Oh Yes, Rise Up!

And there is so much you can do for the Kingdom advancement
