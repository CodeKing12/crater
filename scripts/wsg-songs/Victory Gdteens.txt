Now it
I Got The Victory, The Victory

Because The Devil Is Defeated and God Be Praised
I Got The Victory, The Victory

Every Situation I Face I Win
I Got The Victory, The Victory

And Everything Works For My Good In The End
I Got The Victory, The Victory

[Verse 1:]

I Thought I Lost
But Actually I Won

For By His Blood We All Have Overcome
There is No Failure

Our God Can Never Lose
And that Same Power It Now Belongs To You

[Verse 2:]

I Was On My Way To A Burning Hell
The Devil He Had My Life Set Up To Fail

But Thanks Be To My God Who Causes Me
Triumph, Overcome, To Tread Upon The Enemy

[Verse 3:]

Somebody Who
Right Now You Think You

You Feel LIke You Can
Cause You

Greater is He That Is Within You, Don
Whatever You

You Have To Come Out
