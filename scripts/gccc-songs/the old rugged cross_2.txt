On a hill far away stood an old
the emblem of suffering and
and I love that old cross where the
for a world of lost sinners was slain.

So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
till my trophies at last I lay down;
I will cling to the old rugged cross,
and exchange it some day for a

O that old rugged cross, so
has a wondrous attraction for me;
for the dear Lamb of God left his
to bear it to dark Calvary.

In that old rugged cross, stained
a wondrous beauty I see,
for 'twas on that old cross Jesus
to pardon and sanctify me.

To that old rugged cross I will ever
its shame and reproach gladly
then he'll call me some day to my
where his glory forever I'll share.
