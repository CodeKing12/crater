Come Holy Spirit, I need you
Come sweet Spirit, I pray

Come in your strength and your power
Come in your own gentle way

Come as a rest to the weary
Come as a balm to the sore

Come Lord as strength to my weakness
Fill me with joy evermore

Come Holy Spirit, I need you
Come sweet Spirit, I pray

Come in your strength and your power
Come in your own gentle way

Come like a spring in the desert
Come to the withered of soul

Lord let your sweet healing power
Touch me and make me whole

Come Holy Spirit, I need you
Come sweet Spirit, I pray

Come in your strength and your power
Come in your own gentle way

Come in your own gentle way
