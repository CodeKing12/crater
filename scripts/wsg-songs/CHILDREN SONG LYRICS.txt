Children are the heritage of the Lord

Children are rewards from the Lord

Children are the heritage of the Lord

Children are rewards from the Lord

They are reward from God most high

Young they maybe now but great tomorrow

The Lord himself

Had made them high

Above adults

And mighty men

So let us come

And join the blessings

To make friends with God's heritage

We are the chosen generation

A royal priesthood

A Holy nation

A peculiar people

To show forth the praises of him

Who has called us

Out of darkness

Out of darkness

Out of darkness

Into his marvelous light ...

Into his marvelous light ...
