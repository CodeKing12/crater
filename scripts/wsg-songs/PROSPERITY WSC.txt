Verse
I walk in abundance

I walk in favor

I move in the spirit

With the speed of the holyghost

No limitations

I'm spreading everywhere

I permeate

I am fruitful, I prosper

Chorus
Prosperity, Prosperity

Prosperity, I'm in great prosperity.

Oh oh moving in overflow

We're moving in overflow

We're soaring , soaring

We are glowing, glowing

We are rising

Higher, higher and higher

Oh oh moving in overflow

We're moving in overflow
