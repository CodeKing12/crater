ALL THE WAY

I know you feeling this song
And you like this boy

Feeling my swag
Would you sing along high high.....

Put your sorrow away
Far away oh eh

No matter who you are no matter
Where you

Sing along praise the LORD high...
Lets celebrate all the way oh oh

So we go dey thank the LORD for him mercy
Thank the LORD for the things wey him do

Pick me up whenever i

Now my life is turned to brand new

Oh oh high high high......

Make we jolly, shake body, the party don start


we go dey hail...
Hail your name day by day
All the way all the way...


See my lie oh n bubbling
All the money pilling

Emi no more dulling like or hate it i
High high high.....

No more delay, no delay oh eh

We dey going higher forward ever loke loke
Backward never oh oh

Owo n be lapo mi oh
Ijo ti ya o
Ejo mi ko oh oh

So we go dey thank the LORD for him mercy
Thank the LORD for the things wey him do

Pick me up whenever i
Now my life is turned to brand new

Oh oh high high high......
Make we jolly, shake body, the party don start

All the way all the way.....
