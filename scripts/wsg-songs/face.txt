WHEN I SEE YOU

I wonder what

I wonder how I will feel

When I see You

I see You face to face

I wonder how

I wonder what I will do

When I see You

I see You face to face

One thing is sure

A stream will flow out of me

Deep will call unto deep

Inside of me


Yahweh

This is what I'll do

When I see You face to face

Then I better start it now

Yahweh

Worship is what I'll do

When I see You face to face

Then I better start it now



I'll be praising

I'll be singing

I'll be dancing

When I see you

When I see you



Wo mi o

Bi mo sen fegbe yin baba

Wo mi o

Bi no se fegbe yin Jesu o



Gbope wa


Gbayin wa
