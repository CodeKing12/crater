spirit move on me
spirit move on me
spirit move on me

Let me run with you
Let me run with you
Let me run with you

Fill me with new wine
Fill me with new wine
Fill me with new wine

For my time is now
so let the river flow
so let the river flow
For my time is now

For my time is now
let the kingdom come
let the kingdom come
For my time is now

let the glory come
let the glory come
let the glory come
For my time has come

Let the increase come
Let the increase come
Let the increase come
let the glory come

This wine has poured
