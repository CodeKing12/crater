Holy spirit,
I love you

You guide me in all things
You guide me in all things

Holy spirit
Holy spirit

You have opened my eyes
You have opened my eyes

Holy spirit
Holy spirit

You see I realise
With you I need nobody

'Cause you talk to me
And you are guiding me

And to my surprise
You are more real, Than the air I breathe

Holy ghost
Holy ghost

You guide me in all things
You guide me in all things

Holy spirit
Holy spirit

You have opened my eyes
You have opened my eyes

Holy spirit
Holy spirit

We realise with you
we have all that we need

'Cause you are guiding us
And you are directing us

And to our surprise
You are real than the air we breathe

Precious Holy ghost
Holy ghost

You guide me in all things
You guide me in all things

Holy spirit

Have opened my eyes
You have opened my eyes
