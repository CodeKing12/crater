PRAISES

Thank you oh my maker

For making me who I am

For the gift of life

Good good health

From a victim to a victor

From a loser to a winner

Your grace and mercy turn me on

From story to glory

never knew I could be so happy

I'm grateful cos you rock my world


Time for us to celebrate

Time for us to jubilate

Praise the lord somebody

Praise the lord somebody
