Take your coal,
cleanse my lips
Here I am

Take me pass the outer court
into your Holy place
Pass the brazen alter, Lord i

Take me pass the crowd of
And the priest who sings your
Lord i hunger and thirst for

Take me into the holy of
Take me in by the blood of
Take me into the Holy of
Take your coal, cleanse my
here i am
