Looking out from his throne,

the father of light and of men

Choose to make himself known

and show us the way back to him

Speaking wisdom and truth

into the hearts of peasants and kings

He began to unveil the word

that would change the course of all things.

With eyes wide open, all would see

The Word is alive

And it cuts like a sword through the darkness

With a message of life

to the hopeless and afraid

Breathing life into all who believe

The Word is alive

And the world and it's glories will fade

But his Truth, it will not pass away

It remains yesterday and forever the same

The Word is alive

Simple strokes on a page

Eternity's secrets revealed,

carried on from age to age

It speaks Truth to us even still

And as the rain falls from heaven,

feeds the earth before it returns

LORD, let your word fall upon us

and bring forth the fruit you deserve

With eyes wide open, let us see

The word is alive

And it cuts like a sword through the darkness

With a message of life

to the hopeless and afraid

Breathing life into all who believe

The Word is alive

And the world and it's glories will fade

But his Truth, it will not pass away

It remains yesterday and forever the same

The Word is alive.
