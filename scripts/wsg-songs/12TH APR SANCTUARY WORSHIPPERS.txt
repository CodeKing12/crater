SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

you are good and your mercy is forever

halleluyah...

Worthy worthy...
worthy is the lamb

I've climbed into the highest mountain
looked all around
Couldn't find nobody

I went down into the deepest valley

Searched all around down there
Couldn't find nobody

I went across the deep blue sea
Couldn't find one to compare

To your grace your love
Your mercy

Nobody greater
Nobody greater than you
