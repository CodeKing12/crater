MINISTERING
WHEN WE PRAY

Be careful for nothing

But in prayer make your request known

We will not be quiet

Nations depend on our prayer

At the mention of the name of Jesus

Anything Is possible

I see victories everywhere

Testimonies everywhere

The prayer is working for my good

The earnest, heartfelt

Continued prayer of a righteous man prevaileth much

It changes hopeless situation

God is eager to hear us

Grants our desire when we pray

When we pray

God is eager to hear us

Grants our desire when we pray

When we pray

When we pray in Jesus name

We make changes everywhere

When we pray in Jesus name

God hears us

He answers

We pray we pray

In Jesus name

When we pray we see Jesus

Oh when we pray

There

There is dominion

There is power

When we pray, when we pray

When the clouds be full

They surely empty themselves

Your words will not come back to you void

So keep praying

When we pray

There

All the walls are falling down, when we pray

God is eager to hear us

Grants our desire when we pray

When we pray

God is eager to hear us

Grants our desire when we pray
