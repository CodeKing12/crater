verse
Ruler, king, father, raiser, potter,

builder, source, sustainer, strength,

joy giver, life in abundance,

39 lashes he was Beaten by the son of men

he came to save, the stripes which took care of our sicknesses and diseases

The King took upon himself the form of servant,

being made in human likeness,

Raiser! He came in as a Baby King,

Gave his life as a Ransom for many

He came to bear all  pains  the devil

inflicts on the children of men,

Born of a woman,Born under the law

to make propitiation for our sins

With compassion, he died, because of our little living

that was brought into LIFE, courtesy of his death

That we may have Life and have it in Abundance

He was made sin, who knew no sin,

so we all can have his righteousness

Washed our feet so we can wash one another

to have a part with him ..an ensample to all men

He didn

The joy of the world was beaten to pulp

and hung on the tree made by the ones he came to save

crowned with thorns and spitted upon.

His hallowed death brought to us the life we live now

Redeemed by his blood

Sanctified by his blood

Purified by his blood

Oh how amazing ,giving us equal

access to the Father! The Source

We can boldly testify of eternal Life

We  gave ourselves to the sacrifice of the death

by receiving him,believing in the son

to have eternal Life

We now stand to the world as kings and priests.

Now, we are changed

Transfigured and birth with newness of spirit

verse
Iwoloba awon oba(You are the king of kings )

eledumare o  (the great moulder)

Oluwa Oluwa etobiloba o  (Lord you are so great)
