nullGROWTH

The journey of a thousand miles,

they Say..begins with a Step...

But these steps, our Steps;

Weren't just

Not the steps of mere men

Who walks blindly in obscurity ... Never!

Our Steps in Growth started with a Humble Heart...

He took to the hill from all pleasurable Distractions

and lowered himself first

into the Kimberly of the Sword of the Spirit, "The Word Of God"...

From there, He dug and drew out endless wells

of Living Water from the


holes of Divinity down to the tap of Humanity

...And He fed men with the Life of God in purity...

With the Expertise of Grace taught and exercised

in the mouth and Life of God's

We also became one in this Holy Vision of Gloriousness

Yes, I and Many More

Who knew nothing about the Great Wisdom of God,

Now celebrates this gracious life birthed 16 years ago...

oh! What if this Vision wasn't birthed?

The Mystery of God the Father would ever be hidden from us, sons...Wow!

Family problems would have limited us...

Spiritual wickedness would have held us bound

Emotional feelings would have cheated us

Sin, Sicknesses, Challenges, and more would have enslaved us!

But See!

God found us!

Oh! He found us and in this Vision,

And  we were made free by the power of God's Word!

Free from those limitations the devil blinded us with!

Now we are an Army of the Living God...
