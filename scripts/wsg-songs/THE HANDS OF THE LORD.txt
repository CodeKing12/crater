he raised me from the miry

clay and put me on the solid rock

now I'm shining in his light

every morning ,noon and night

the devil is a liar

AM gonna flog him with my wire

that's why I no dey tire

cause I'm in the choir

the Lord is my sustainer

my rock and my defender

From January to December

I go always dey remember

say baba God my defender

His grace wey he dey render

Cus devil no fit end am

And nothing for fit hinder

cus I'm always a soul winner

And take the world like a leader

because I'm a teacher a preacher and giver
