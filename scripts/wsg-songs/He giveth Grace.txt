He giveth more grace

when our burdens grow greater,

He sendeth more strength

when the labors increase;

To added afflictions He addeth His mercy

To multiplied trials He multiplies peace.

His love has no limits

His grace has no measure,

His power no boundary known unto men;

For out of His infinite riches in Jesus

He giveth, and giveth, and giveth again.

When we reach the end

of our hoarded resources

Our Father's full giving is only begun

His love has no limit

His grace has no measure

His pow'r has no boundary known unto men

For out of His infinite riches in Jesus

He giveth, and giveth, and giveth again

His love has no limit

His grace has no measure

His pow'r has no boundary known unto men

For out of His infinite riches in Jesus

He giveth, and giveth, and giveth again

For out of His infinite riches in Jesus

He giveth, and giveth, and giveth again
