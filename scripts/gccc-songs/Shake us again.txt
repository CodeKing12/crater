Shake us again(2x)
Only you can shake us again

Early in the morning
before the break of the day
only you can shake us again

Revive us aagain
Only you can revive us again

Shake us again,
shake us again,
only You can shake us again.

wake us again,
wake us again,
only You can wake us again.


Early in the morning, before the break
take Your loving hands and shake us
Shake us with Your glory, as bright as
Lord, don't forsake us, but shake us


Sometimes I feel like Job, broken
shaken to pieces, set up for the mob.
But Lord you know what's best,
to get us through our test,
and we wont rebel as You shake us
