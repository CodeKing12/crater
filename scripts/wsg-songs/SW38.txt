PRAISE TEAM

Your brighter day has come

The weary night has passed away

All that you do long for they are right here very nigh

Rejoice now everyday cos his word will never change

so raise your voice now sing him a new song

chorus

Oh I love you Jesus

for all you've done for me

for all you're still doing

you are wonderful

You are glorious

You are awesome God

You are mighty God

I praise you Jesus


He's a present shelter in time of storm

a living shield from burning heat

a living water to quench my thirst

He's the bread of life for my consumption

Don't ever mind the trials and danger

Remember the King that rose from the manger

He's calling you now to bear his burden

He sees your heart

He knows your thought

only hold to your faith and sing to him say
