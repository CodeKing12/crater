SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

Kini mafi san ore re
BI o ti po to laye mi

Egberun ahon  ko
To fun iyin re

Kabiesi ooo

Olodumare

Oba to'n gbe inu awa

I and My Father are one,
He is the love of my life

He's my glory

And I've got cause to shout

Greater is He that is in me

Than he that is in the whole world

I have overcome by the blood of the Lamb

I am more than a conqueror

For Jesus is my Lord

Jehovah eh eh eh,
Jehovah ah ah  ah

Jehovah
You are the Most High

You are the Most High God

Tere muka tere muka

Banda Banda Banda Banda

Echirim samsa chirichimu
(What makes me happy)

Yesu molokoto afayo o
(Is that Jesus cares)

Jesu Afayo
(Afayo)

Jesus cares,
He cares

For what you have done for us

We've come to say we are grateful

Lord, we praise you
(We praise you)

Lord, we love you
(We love you)
