Before The Throne is where we come

To offer praise and seek wisdom

You have torn the veil that separates

No more outside, now in Your grace

Great are you Lord

Greatly to be praised

Greatly to be praised

Father You reign

Great are You Lord

Greatly to be Praised

Greatly to be praised

Father you reign

My Daddy, my Daddy

Your baby is singing

I will be singing

And dancing and shouting

For the rest of eternity

only u can do what no man can do

Jehovah!
