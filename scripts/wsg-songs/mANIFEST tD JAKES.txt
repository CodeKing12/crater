Pregnant possibilities, Now birth a new
Travailing to obtain it

For it must come to past
I decree it, declare it

And call it in the spirit
To become what God's designed me to be

Your future, Your promises
Shall be fulfilled

Yes you, Shall obtain it
For it must come to pass

I decree it, And call it in the spirit

To become what God's designed me to be

I decree it, And call it in the spirit

Manifest, Manifest, Manifest, Manifest
Become what God's designed me/you to be
