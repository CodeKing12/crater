I've found a friend who is all to me

His love is ever true

I love to tell how He lifted me

And what His grace can do for you.

CHORUS

Saved by His pow'r divine,

Saved to new life sublime!

Life now is sweet and my joy is complete,

For I'm saved, saved, saved.

TAG

He saves me from ev'ry sin and harm

Secures my soul each day

I'm leaning strong on His mighty arm

I know He'll guide me all the way

TAG

When poor and needy and all alone

In love He said to me

Come unto Me and I'll lead you home

To live with Me eternally
