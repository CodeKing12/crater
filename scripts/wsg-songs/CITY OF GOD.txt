Let your living water flow out of me

Let your Holy Spirit

overshadow me

As it was in the beginning

so let it be now

I am the city,the city of God

CHORUS
Eden is no more a place

I am the city of God

I bring heaven

heaven here on earth

VERSE
Let your living water flow out of me

Let your Holy Spirit

overshadow me

As it was in the beginning

so let it be now

I am the city,the city of God .

There's a river inside of me that is able to drown the world

TAG
Eden is no more a place

I am the city of God

You're the river that never runs dry
