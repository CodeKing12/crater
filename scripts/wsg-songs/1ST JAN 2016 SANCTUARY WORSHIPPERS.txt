SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

How can I describe

The Lord that's indescribable

How can I explain

The Lord that's unexplainable

Am even lost for words

Oh oh oh,
My heart sings oh oh oh...


Looked around and suddenly realized

That you've been so good to me

Your Mercy is Everlasting,
Undenying, Overwhelming

Who am I that you are mindful of

Who am I that you hear my call
When I call you

Who am I that you are mindful of

Who am I that you hear my cries

The source of my strength
Na you

The strength of my life
Na you

My hope and my joy
Na you

My confidence
Na you

We exalt you
Oh God

Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh ...

You are my magnificent obsession

Object of my desire

The Lord divine

How can I love you more,

See you more, feel you more,

Feel you more and know you more

Oh oh oh oh

You are so beautiful, so wonderful,
You

Lord you
