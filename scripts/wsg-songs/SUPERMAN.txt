I can do anything

You can call me SuperMan

The spirit of God Lives in me

He's given me the ability

So take a good look at me

I walk by faith and not by sight

It's not by power nor by might

I can do anything

You can call me SuperMan

The spirit of God Lives in me

He's given me the ability

So take a good look at me

I walk by faith and not by sight

It's not by power nor by might

Born of the seed of Abraham

I know who I am

I am wonderfully, fearfully made

I have a Goodly Heritage

My lines have fallen unto pleasant places

I know who I am
