not by power
not by might
but by His Spirit
says the Lord of Host

i will build my church
i will build my church
i will build my people
says the Lord of Host

i will raise my church
i will raise my church
i will raise my people
says the Lord of Host

not by your calculations
not by your feelings
but by His Spirit
says the Lord of Host


your Spirit is moving
your Spirit is changing
your Spirit is saving
to the uttermost

Jesus is moving
Jesus is changing
Jesus is saving
to the uttermost
