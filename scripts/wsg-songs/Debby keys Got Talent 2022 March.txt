All of that you created are beautiful

You created me in your likeness

And I've searched and searched all over the earth

I found no one like you

VERSE
Mo wo rere aye
(I looked all around the earth)

Ko seni bi re se
(no one like you, the deliverer)

Ko seni bi re o
(no one like you, the deliverer)

Oludande
(You are my deliverer)

VERSE
You are my strength when I am weak

You are my defender, you fight my battles for me

And I will exalt you, above all other gods ooo..

Gbati ko si iranlowo
(When there was no help)

E o do ju ti mi
(You didn't disappoint me)

From the ages past

You've always been faithful

When it's as if all hope was lost, you stood by me

There's nothing I can give you if not praises
