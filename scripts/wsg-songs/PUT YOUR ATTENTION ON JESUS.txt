MINISTERING
PUT YOUR ATTENTION ON JESUS

It's amazing how we've gone after the show

How we hardly say His name anymore

I think it's strange how we love to jump and shout

But never wanna tell the world what it's about

I'm amazed that the One who gave His life

Is not the feature of every single night

I think it's sad how the man who paid the price

Is being drowned out by all the fluff and lights

Let's put the attention

Back where it belongs

Back upon the Son

He is the one who died for us

Let's put the attention

Back upon the cross

Back upon the Lord

He is the King He's why we sing

Yes in the midst of dead tis there he came to live

And then he gave his life for all the walking dead

But yet you see men falling again

In search for the greeness and pleasure of the world

There is Greatness in the name of the Lord

There is Greeness in the name of the Lord

Put your attention on him and you'll not be put to shame

Cause he's the one in whom destiny belong

Let's put the attention

Back where it belongs

Back upon the Son

He is the one who died for us

Let's put the attention

Back upon the cross

Back upon the Lord

He is the King He's why we sing

Put the attention on Jesus

Cause that's where it belongs

Put the attention on Jesus

Yeah yeah

If I be lifted up

From all the earth

I'll draw all men unto me

If I be lifted up

From all the earth

I'll draw men unto me

Put the attention on Jesus

Forever we lift you up

Put the attention on Jesus

Yeah yeah

Yeah yeah

Yeah yeah.......

(What's His name)

Fruitful Fruitful....
