YOUR PRESENCE IS HEAVEN

VERSE1
Who is like you Lord in all in the earth

Matchless love in beauty endless world

Nothing in this world would satisfy

Jesus you're the cup that wont run dry

CHORUS
Your presence is heaven to me
Your presence is heaven to me

VERSE2
Treasure of my heart and of my soul

in my weakness you are merciful

Redeemer of my past and presence wrong

Holder of my future days to come

CHORUS
Your presence is heaven to me
Your presence is heaven to me

Oh Jesus
oh Jesus

your presence is heaven to me

All my days on earth i will await
'till moment that i'll see you face to face

For nothing in this world will satisfy

Jesus you're the cup that wont run dry
