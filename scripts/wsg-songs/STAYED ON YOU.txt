MINISTERING
STAYED ON YOU

I
Stayed on you

VERSE 1
This is the day the lord has made

I will rejoice and got to be glad
Jesus i love you so

You changed my life and i will never let you go

But that old devil he tried
And tried to pull me back

And make me fall by the way side
Oh my heart is fixed and
I...I...

I
Stayed on you

VERSE 2
Ok when trouble is gone my way

I
Couse i know night becomes day

All things work together for the good

So i will trust and obey cause even
Still life could be worse

You have been so good

I give you all my worship

The storms of life will always blow but

You give me perfect peace

I

Woah...oh... uh...
woah...
