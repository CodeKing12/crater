Verse
We declare your majesty
We proclaim that your name is exalted

For you reign magnificent
You rule victorious

Your power is shown throughout the earth
And we exclaim

Our God is mighty
We lift up your name

For you are Holy
Sing it again

All Honour and Glory in Adoration
We bow before your throne
