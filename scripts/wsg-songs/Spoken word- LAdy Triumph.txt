SOURCE

The soul yearns for the place of communion.
Its longs for a lasting relationship that never breaks.

There is a place where every  man finds his true origin...

The true identity of men is found in a place where spirits are formed...
Where lives are changed

The source is an embodiment of fatherhood and the love of motherhood.
How can you be formed without these?

Have you found your source? Have you found the place?

The personality of purity defined and
redefined by the divine nature of God in man...

The spirit of the source never fails
It is in the source we go to to find answers to life's questions...

The source maintains the flow of life and wisdom to you...
Who is your source?

At a time when you are dearly in need of love, attention and grace,
Who do you go to?

When the world has turned it's back on you,
do you go back to where you truly come from?

You are not without a trace.
The Father beckons on you today...

The source calls for a oneness more than ever
He is the only way, the true life and the undiluted truth.

Come fetch from the wealth of goodness He has to offer.
The source never runs dry!
