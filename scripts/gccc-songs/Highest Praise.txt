Zion keeps calling me to a higher place of praise
To stand upon the mountain and magnify His name
To tell all the people
And every nation, that He reigns
Zion keeps calling me to a higher place of praise

It becomes my highest praise
When all that I am responds to who You are
It becomes my highest praise
Just to know You Lord
Just to know you lord

Zion - The Most High
