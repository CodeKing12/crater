We are not the usual

No! nothing like the casual

We are not of this World

We are The true

Born For Mighty Manifestations...

Oh Wow, take a look at us and see what a beauty we are

I know you've heard of the Chosen Israel

Whose history is detailed in the scriptures

They experienced God's miracles

But!!! Hmm...

They disappointed God! AND That was it

They did?

Oh yes My friend

And Since Then

There's been no perfect replacement till

Hmm...

You must have met or heard of so many MOGs so called

If I lend you my mic

to outline the lies you've heard from many altars

I'm sure there'd be no end...

But Not ANYMORE

For an army has risen

Vibrant for war with songs of prophecies

The Victory is sure

Our source from Heaven

Our Life In Christ

Yes Christ! The Wisdom and The Power of God

We are God's beloved

Sanctified by the blood of Jesus

To Carry Out the unfailing Vision of God

So Brothers, Remember these words from God to You?

The Owner of the World awaits its precious fruit...

Remember!

Our Manifestation will bring men to their knees

We must never stop

We must keep at it

It is failure to refuse the promptings of the Spirit

So Move Brother

Manifest now

BECAUSE NOW IS THE TIME
