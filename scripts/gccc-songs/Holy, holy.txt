And I will sing
I will sing holy, holy
To my Lord and Savior
My God and King

I will praise the lamb of
God who sits upon the

And give the praise to
He who was and is and

All the angels sing and
And they sing holy
Hallelujah, holy
We, Your sons and
We praise You now
And we cry holy
Yes we cry holy

Holy, I say holy
