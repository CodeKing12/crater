Oh Oh Oh

We bless your name
You are worthy of our praise

I had alot of questions about life
like, why am I here, what am I meant to do

You said you knew me before
I was born before I was formed

I need you to talk to me
I used to ask, Lord are you really here

I'm lost and alone, you gotta show me that you care

But
Its hard to see the frame when you're in the picture

Its had to know the truth when you wouldnt listen

I couldnt see value in life felt so small,
working to be seen, fighting for approval

Dont let the people get to know you
Keep a Distance so they cant hurt you

I followed all the rules
Drew inside the lines

Never asked for anything that wasn't mine
Waiting patiently for my time

But it never came
The lack of knowledge like a void

Something was missing deep inside
I had to look beyond the building,

I was searching for light
But then I found the Light

Who made me light
That helps others see light

Thats a delight

See He stepped in at the right time
this is the truth and not just rhymes

He came in and He changed me
reached for my hand and you saved me

Oh Oh Oh

From the dust of the earth He made us
Then He put his spirit deep inside us

Divine ominipotent effacement
Made us all Kings and Priests to nations

I'm so thankful for the life you gave
The Glory you shared

The sacrifices that you made

Lord you shed your blood to break us out of the
bonds of sin and shame set us on the throne

I see visions of your pierced hands

Your bruised eyes
Your slashed side

Lord I see your love in your eyes
Yeah I hear Him in your voice

I sense him when you move
Bask in Him when I pray

This love ain't gonna dim

This Father-son relationship has got my soul redeemed

Purpose that I found started when my heart believed

When my heart received
Your word, Your promise, Your seed

Now I love you unashamed cause
I know I'm who you did it for

I'm who you died for
Challenges and trials may come

Situations may put up a front

Might fight some battles on earth
but My Jesus he don' won the war

We bless your name
Oh most holy Father

Most gracious God
We bless your name

Our Saviour and redeemer Christ

We bless your name
Says the Lord unto my Lord

We bless your name
For you have won the victory

Amen
You have won the victory

And you're seated on the throne

Amen
You have made us Kings and Priests

And we're seated on the throne

Awa l'omo onile.  Ehha
Awa l'omo onile. Eh eh

We bless your name
You are worthy of our praise

We bless your name
You are worthy of our praise

Oh oh oh

Adoration be to the highest king
With wisdom and power he speaks

In all the Earth, there is none like him
Humble yourself, bow before him

The Lord is great, In Zion Let his praises ring
With a joyful noise, his praise we sing.

Yes, The Lord is merciful and gracious
His love endureth forever more.

Bless the Lord, O my soul
Honour and majesty to the king of Kings

All power and Glory to him be
His Kingdom is forevermore

We lift our hands to rever the one
who's high and mighty on the throne

Sent out His word into space and
called forth the light from the void

Yes we were told

Of His awesomeness and His sacrifice on the cross
As the Lamb, crucified, He should rise

The holy one, lamb of God
And through Him all men should relate

Not by blood or flesh but by God
One God, One people, One voice

Through His spirit, holy Life Eternal
He had it all planned out

His word the living foundation

Eternal life the expectation
And Heaven final destination

Adoration, Adoration
To the Master, the Saviour, the Healer

I am that I am
Only true God

Elshaddai, Elohim, Elyon
Adoration to you mighty God

Hands lifted evening sacrifice
Eyes fixed now were fortified

Hearts open Lord be glorified

Amen

You have won the victory
And you're seated on the throne

Amen

You have made us Kings and Priests
And we're seated on the throne

Glory Honour to the one that sits on the throne
Let us bow down before him and Worship him

Behold, his Kingdom is here, Everlasting.
Behold, there we his elect are Worshipping him.

We bless your name
You are worthy of our praise

We bless your name
You are worthy of our praise
