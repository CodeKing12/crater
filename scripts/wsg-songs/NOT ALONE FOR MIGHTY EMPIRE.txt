NOT ALONE FOR MIGHTY EMPIRE

VERSE
Not alone for mighty empire
Stretching far o
Not alone for bounteous harvests
Do we praise you gratefully,
Standing in the living present
Memory and hope between
Lord, we would with deep thanksgiving
Praise you most for things unseen.

VERSE 2
Not for battleship and fortress
Not for conquests of the swords
But for conquests of the spirit
We give thanks to you, O Lord
For the heritage of freedom
For the home, the church, the school
For the open door to justice
In a land the people rule.

VERSE 3
For the armies of the faithful
Those who passes and left no name
For the glory that illumines
Patriot lives of deathless fame
For our prophet and apostles
Loyal to the living word
For the strong and free in spirit
We give thanks to you, o Lord.

VERSE 4
God of justice, save the people
From the dash of race and creed
From the strife of class faction
Make our nation free indeed
Keep it faith in simple justice
Strong as when its life began
Till it find its full fruition
By the guiding of your hand
