We lift our hands to the
Great I Am

We lift our hands to the
Great I Am
you who created us in your likeness
Who is there like you
oh God
Is an honor lord to stand
and worship you

Who was and who is and is to come
we lift our hands to the Great I Am
We lift our hands to the
Great I Am
Who can compare with you?
