MINISTERING
BIGGER THAN YESTERDAY

VERSE 1
Yesterday is gone

It's a new beginning

for greater things to come

New season of glory

I thank the Lord for everything

I'm forever grateful

For the things that you've done for me

BRIDGE
Higher I go oh oh

Brighter I glow oh oh

Forward I go oh oh

No stopping me

Higher I go oh oh

Brighter I glow oh oh

Forward I go oh oh

No stopping me

CHORUS
Take a look at me

I'm bigger than my yesterday

Take a look at me

I'm stronger than my yesterday

My life is no longer the same

Greater things await me

This is just the beginning

Greater things await me

This is just the beginning

VERSE 2
Yesterday was great

But the later is greater

Yesterday was beautiful

But it gets better

I thank the Lord for everything

I'm forever grateful

For the things that you've done for me

Higher I go oh oh

Brighter I glow oh oh

Forward I go oh oh

No stopping me.......

CHORUS
Take a look at me
