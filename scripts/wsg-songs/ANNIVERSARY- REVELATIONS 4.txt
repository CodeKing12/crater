We give Glory and honour
Blessings and praise thanksgiving

To the One who sits so mighty on the Throne

God Almighty

You are worthy

Pure and holy

We give glory

You are Lord

And immediately I was in the spirit and, behold

a throne was set in heaven, and one who sat on the throne

And  oh what beauty, what splendor, such majesty, such grace

to look upon him was to look upon a jasper and a sardine stone

and a rainbow emerged from the throne, in sight like unto an emerald

And before the throne, around the throne

I see twenty and four seats and on this seat twenty and four elders

clothe in white with crowns of gold upon their heads

Before the throne is a sea of glass like unto crystal
seven lamps of fire burning before the throne

which are the seven spirits of God.

And I see before and around the throne,
creatures with eyes around their bodies

and everytime they lift their voices to give thanks

to him who seats on the throne, who lives forever and ever

The twenty four elders get on their knees and bow their

heads and they cast their crowns and give God the praise

Lift up your voices and join the hosts of heaven.

You are Lord
