MINISTERING
WHEN THE SAINTS GO TO WORSHIP

When the saints go to worship

When the saints go to worship

Thats when the King of kings shall come in

When the saints go up in praise

Thats when the Spirit shall inhabit this place

When the saints get on one accord

And begin to bless the Lord

Then the King who is strong and mighty

Oh the King who is mighty in battle

Yea the King of glory shall come in

When the saints go to worship

Thats when deliverance will take place

When the saints go up in praise

All of satans power are erased

Every trap the enemy set

Can't work
won't work

Then the King who is strong and mighty
Oh the King

who is mighty in battle

Yea the King of glory shall come in

We welcome You in

You're the King and You're invited to come in

To this sanctuary this tabernacle

You're the King and You're invited to come in

you are welcome in
