SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

VERSE 1
I say these are the days of Elijah e o

Declaring the words of the Lord e o (chai)

These are the days of His servant e o Moses

Righteousness being restored... shelele

I say these are the days of great trials e o

And famine and darkness and sword eh

We are the voice in the desert crying

Preparing the ways of the Lord
(thank you)

CHORUS 1
Behold He comes

Riding on the cloud

Shining like the sun

At the trumpet call

lift your voice

Is the year of jubilee

Out of Zion's hill

Salvation Comes

VERSE 2
Nobody fit be like my God e o

Nobody pass my God e o

God is able to do just what He said He would do

He's gonna fulfill every promise to you

Don't give up on God, cause He won't give up on you

CHORUS 2
He's able

Oh, oh oh oh,

Oh, oh oh oh,

Don't give up on God,
cause He won't give up on you

Everybody say, oh

Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh

He's able
He's able
