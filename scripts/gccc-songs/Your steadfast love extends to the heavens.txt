Your steadfast love extends to the heavens
Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds
Your righteouness is like majestic mountains
And your wisdom like the depth of the sea
And you come to me

Filling my heart with your loving kindness
I find my peace in the shadows of your wings
I eat my fill from the abundance of your household
And I drink from the streams of rejoicing
'Cause you are my king

You are my king
You are my king
You are my king
You are my king
Your steadfast love extends to the heavens
Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds
Your righteouness is like majestic mountains
And your wisdom like the depth of the sea
And you come to me (come to me)

You are my king
You are my king
You are my king
You are my king
