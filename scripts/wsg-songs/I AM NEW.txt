I AM

VERSE 1

I am the maker of the Heavens
I am

The bright and morning star
I am

The breath of all Creation

Who always was

And is to come

I am the One who walked on water
I am

I am the One who calmed the seas.
I am

I am the miracles and wonders

So come and see

And follow me

You will know

Chorus

I am the fountain of living water

The risen Son of man

The healer of the broken

And when you cry

I am your savior and redeemer

Who bore the sins of man

The author and perfecter

Beginning and the end

I am

verse 2
I am the spirit deep inside you

I am the word upon your heart

I am the One who even knew you

Before your birth

Before you were

And when you cry

I am your savior and redeemer

Who bore the sins of man

The author and perfecter

Beginning and the end

I am
