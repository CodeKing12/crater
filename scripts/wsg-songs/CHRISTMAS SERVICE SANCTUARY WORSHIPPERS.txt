PRAISES

These are the days of Elijah

Declaring the works of the lord

These are the days of your servant moses
Righteousness being restored

These are the days of great trials
Of famine and darkness and sword

We are the voice in the desert crying
Prepare ye the way of the lord

CHORUS
Behold he comes, riding on the cloud

Shining like the sun, as the trumpet calls

Lift your voice it

Out of Zion

BRIDGE
There

If you call to him he will answer us

If we run to him he will run to us

If we lift our hands he will lift us up

Come now praise his name all ye saints of God

You are the reason why we are singing

Jehovah you are the most high God

Jehovah you are the reason
Jehovah Imela okaka

Jehovah baba ni baba n je
Jehovah  baba ni  baba n se
