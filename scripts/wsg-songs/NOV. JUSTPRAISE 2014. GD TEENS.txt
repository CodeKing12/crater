GD TEENS CHOIR
MINISTERING
LOST

i will seek you
until i found you

for the rest of my life
l'will keep running after you

i,m lost without you

i finally found,my place,in you

drifted away

am here to stay

save in your grace

there no turnning back now

i'm closer than have everbeen before

there is tranquility

less in security

save in you arms

so glad i found you

the search is over now

am right where i belong

i found you
