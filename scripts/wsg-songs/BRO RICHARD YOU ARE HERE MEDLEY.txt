Praise the Father, Praise the Son
Praise the Spirit, Three in one

God of Glory, Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings

You are here, You are here Lord
Have Your way, As we bow down

Take control here and now

Thank you for the cross Lord, Thank you for the price You paid

Bearing all my sin and shame, In love You came
And gave amazing grace

Thank you for Your love Lord, Thank you for Your nail pierced hands

You washed me in Your cleansing flow, Now all I know
Your forgiveness and embrace

Worthy is the Lamb, Seated on the throne

Crown You now with many crowns, You reign victorious

High and lifted up, Jesus Son of God
The treasure of Heaven crucified,

Worthy is the Lamb

We worship You, We worship You
Worship You, Dear Lord

You are here, You are here Lord
Have Your way, As we bow down

Take control here and now
