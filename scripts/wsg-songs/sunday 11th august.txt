Wonderful, merciful Savior

Precious Redeemer and Friend

Who would have thought that a Lamb

Could rescue the souls of men

Oh, You rescue the souls of men

You are the One that we praise

You are the One we adore

You give the healing and grace

Our hearts always hunger for

You are good, You are kind

I have never seen You kind

I'm devoted to Your praise

And forever to Your name

You are love, You are light

You make everything alright

I'm devoted to Your praise

And forever to Your name

You're my joy, You're my hope

I will never be ashamed

I'm devoted to Your praise

And forever to Your name

Now unto the One upon the Throne

We raise a sound

For He is God and God alone

Hallelujah

Now unto the One upon the Throne

We raise a sound

From every Nation, Tribe and Tongue

Hallelujah

For He is worthy

To receive glory, honour and praise

Ay ay-ay ay

Hallelujah ay ay ay

Hallelujah ay ay ay
