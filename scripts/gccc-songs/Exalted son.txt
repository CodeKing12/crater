The first begotten of
Elohim, adonai, a
Obedient master of his
He's lifted far above all

Ascended to the throne
He giveth life so
We rejoice in the son
Other sons are being

Odi pataki igun ile
( he became the chief

O d'osha
(he became God)

Omo'lohun g'akaba
( the son of God

O d'oge
( He's beautified).
