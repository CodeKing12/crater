Behold, the mountain of the Lord

VERSE 1
Behold, the mountain of the Lord
In latter days shall rise
On mountain tops, above the hills,
And draw the wondering eyes

VERSE 2
The beam that shine from Zion's hill
Shall lighten every land;
The King who reigns in Salem's tower
Shall all the world command.

VERSE 3
Among the nations he   shall judge;
His judgments truth shall guide,
His scepter shall protect the just,
And quell the sinner's pride.

VERSE4
No strife nor rage, nor hostile feuds
Disturb the peaceful years;
To ploughshares soon they beat their swords
To pruning hooks their spears.


Come, then, O house of Jacob, come,
And lift up Jesus Christ
And, walking in the light of God,
Throughout the nations shine



Hail to the brightness of Zion

Hail to the brightness of Zion

Joy to the lands that in darkness have lain!

Hushed be the accents of sorrow and mourning.

Zion in triumph begins her glad reign.

Lo! in the desert the flowers are springing;

Streams, ever copious, are gliding along.

Loud from the mountaintops echoes are ringing;

Wastes rise in verdure and mingle in song.

See from all lands, from the isles of the ocean,

Praise to Jehovah ascending on high.

Fallen the engines of war and commotion;

Shouts of salvation are rending the sky.
