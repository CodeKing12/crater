I live above the world, my standard
I

I wasn
You

Your eyes are blinded, speech corrupted,
Your mind is tainted, vain.

You walk in sin, you think you
Correction cane and you resort to strife

You
â€˜

I live above the world, my standard
I

Are you rooted? Or are you shaking?
Living pretentious, the word forsaken

Churchgoer, with standards worldly
Leader, the vision misrepresenting.

You speak truth, it
Your heart burns as you flash smiles

It
It

I live above the world, my standard
I

What is this throne life I speak?
It is the smile on the face of Jesus you see

The fragrance of the word blossoming within
It is the reality of God with whom you are one

The light ever so bright in your souls won
It is the joy of the spirit wherein you dwell

The love in my heart calling to you
It says

I live above the world, my standard
I

There
It

The life in you beyond expression
Gaining dominion in the hearts of men.

Receive the call, it
The gospel preached from your lips to all ears

It
It

I live above the world, my standard
I
