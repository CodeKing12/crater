How precious
How loving

Are your thoughts oh lord
Towards us

How truly amazing
Is the grace that you have
Shown

Oh majesty i live to see
Your face

I will search for you
And i will find you

I will find you with all my Heart

I will lift my hands to you And worship

I will worship with all my Heart

Oh uh oh
I will worship you with all My heart

Nobody greater
Uh uh

Nobody greater than you

Searched all over
Couldn't find nobody

I looked high and low
Still couldn't find nobody

I'm on my way

On my way

I'm on my way to better Days

Awesome is not enough to show how credible you are

You stretched me wide
