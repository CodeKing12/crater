Wonderful Wonder

Summer, winter, autumn, spring

Mountains, Blue skies and the seas

Rainbow, Sunshine, and the trees

Jesus, Maker of them all

Everywhere I go, I see you right there

In the beauty of nature, you shine all around

For you are everything, everything is you

Precious Jesus a wonderful wonder you are

Oooh, oh oh, wooooh

Voices, Rhythms, Melody

People places, everything

Jesus maker of them all
