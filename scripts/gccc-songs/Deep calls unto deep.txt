Deep calls unto deep
Life calls unto life
Spirit calls unto spirit
I hear the sound of heaven over me

There is a river
A river living deep inside of me
It's calling me to deep deep waters
There is a river living deep inside of me
It's calling me to deep deep waters

Deep deep waters
Deep waters
Deep deep waters
Deep deep waters
Deep deep waters

Out-of my belly shall flow rivers of living waters
As the deer pants for the brooks
So my soul longs for you
Oh Lord I'm thirsty, I'm thirsty for a drink
And let your rivers
Roll over me

There is a fountain
A foutain springing up inside of me
It's springing up to life, life eternal

There is an ocean
An ocean living deep inside of me
It's calling me to deep
Deep deep waters

Omi to jin
(Deep waters)
Omi to jin
(Deep waters)
To jin
(Deep)

You are the stirring in my belly
You are the stirring in my belly
Out of my belly shall flow rivers of living waters
