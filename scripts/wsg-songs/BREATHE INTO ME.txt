WSMCI
MINISTERING
BREATHE INTO ME

verse 1
When the battle makes me weary

It seems that I have lost ground

It's so hard to hear your voice Lord

With distractions all around

I try to lift my hands, to give you praise

But then the spirit of heaviness,
Tries to shield your face

chorus
Breathe into me oh Lord,
the breath of Life

So that my spirit would be whole,
And my soul made right

Breathe into me oh Lord,
day by day

So that my heart is pure before you,
always, always

verse 2
Unto thee oh Lord do I lift up my soul

It's only by your hand,
That I can be made whole

So Lord breathe on me,
And revive my spirit within

And I'll never be the same...

verse 3
Condemnation tries to hold me,
like a prisioner in chains

And the weight of my burdens is calling out my name

That's when I lift up my voice to worship you,
Because I know you

You promised you would wash me

Jesus wash me white as snow

Unto thee oh Lord do I lift up
My soul

It's only by your hand that
I can be made whole

So Lord let your breath,
Revive me again

I'll never be the same...

Breathe into me oh Lord,
the breath of Life

So that my spirit would be whole

And my soul made right

Breathe into me oh Lord,
day by day

So that my heart is pure before you,
always, always

Unto thee oh Lord oh,
Lord do I lift up my soul
