FIREWORKS

Yeah!

Put your hands up yeah would you please

God bless you all

Hands up

Can't you feel it?

Hit me

Don't act like you seen a ghost

When we were all of one accord

A mighty rush of wind came

As they were waiting on the Lord

That's when the Holy Ghost came down

Just like fireworks in the room

Something special happens

When we get together, it's like "boom!"

Put your lights up y'all

Let your light shine....

Gotta let your light shine

Let your light shine.

Send up praise like fireworks

Lift the Savior high (Send it up)

Send up praise like fireworks

Illuminate the sky..

We are the salt of the earth

We're the light of the world

So illuminate

Turn on the lights chase all the darkness

Let your light shine.....

Gotta let your light shine

Let your light shine

Send up praise like fireworks

Lift the Savior high (Send it up)

Send up praise like fireworks

Illuminate the sky..

No hiding, common out of the hidden place

So many colourful you-me in this room tonight

Shinning out to the world with the brightest light

Bringing out Gods colour in this dark-filled world...

Fireworks illuminators (we got the light we got the light....)

(Send out the praise)

Send up praise like fireworks

Lift the Savior high (Send it up)

Send up praise like fireworks

Illuminate the sky..

Send up praise like fireworks...

Send it up...

Fireworks..

Dominate.....

Festoon me.......

Cover me.......
