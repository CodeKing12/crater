I and my father are one

He is the love of my life

He's my glory and I've got cause to shine

Greater is He that lives in me

than he that lives in the whole world

I have overcome by the blood of the lamb

I am more than a conqueror

Jesus is my Lord

You are the most high

You are the most high God
