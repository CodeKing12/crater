I am glad, I found Jesus so early in
His name is worthy to be known
He kept, me free fro-o- m, chasing
Sooo now, my life is full of his riches

Chorus
Jesus blood has saved me from
Now i know my life Is not my
Oh, what power, what Glory and
Praise God my life Is His alone

I am glad, I found Jesus so early in
He bled and died to make me
He set me free fr-o-m all the guilt
So now I am a part of His sheepfold

I am glad I found Jesus so early in
If He didn't come quick I would be
When He came I knew my search

I am glad I found Jesus so early in
Oh what great gain he Is to me
More than silver and much more
A precious treasure I've found in
