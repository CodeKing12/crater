i come before you
just as i am
lay me at your feet

i bring before you
all that i have
i lay it at your feet

you are worthy worthy
you are worthy worthy

praise like oil
for you i pour it out
for you i pour it out
i pour i pour it out for


its foolishness i know
but your foolishness is
wiser than the wisest
wiser wiser
