daily as i live
often as i breathe
All my days would be

I don't wanna go
without you Lord
No where to go

I don't wanna do
without you Lord
Nothing to do without

I don't wanna say
without you Lord
Nothing to say without

No where to go

Nothing to do without

Nothing to say without

My life is wrapped in
My days are wrapped
My moments are
Wrapped wrapped

We are wrapped in you
We are wrapped in
We are wrapped in you

I am wrapped in you
I am wrapped in your
I am wrapped in you

i'm here

wherever you want
i'm there x3

wherever you go
i'll go x3

whatever you say
i'll say x3

whatever you do
i'll do x3
