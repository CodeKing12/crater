I just want to praise You,

I lift my hands and say I love You

You're are everything to me

And I exalt your holy name

I exalt your holy name

I exalt your holy name on high

You are the reason I live

You're the one for me

Why should I fear when I have you

Surrounded by your love

Your everlasting love

Why should I care what people say

They don't know

What you mean to me

I sing praises to your name Oh Lord

Praises to your name Oh Lord

For your name is great

and greatly to be praise

You're an Incredible God

Incredible God
