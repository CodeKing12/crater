SANCTUARY
WORSHIPPERS

Free to dance and sing

Free to lift my hands and worship

Lord I'm free

Lord I'm free

I'm a free Worshipper

I'm a free Worhipper

I'm a free Worshipper

Lord I'm free

I thank God I'm free and I'll never be bound again

Whom the Son set free is free indeed

I am free

Praise the Lord I'm free

No longer bound

No more chains holding me

My soul is resting

It's just a blessing

Praise the Lord Hallelujah I'm free
