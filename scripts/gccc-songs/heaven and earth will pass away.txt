heaven and earth will pass away
you are the same
the lamb was slain
your pain my gain
i owe you my life
i owe you my days

heaven and earth will pass away
you are the same
the lamb was slain
you are mine

you didn't have to come
but still you came
and now i'm yours
and you are mine


i owe you my life
