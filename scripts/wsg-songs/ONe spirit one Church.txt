We are the pilgrim people
We are the church of God
A family of believers, disciples of the Lord
United in one spirit, ignited by the fire
Still burning through the ages
Still present in our lives.

Come, Holy Ghost Creator Bless
And in our hearts take up thy rest
Come with and thy grace and heavenly aid
To fill the heart which thou hast made

We are the pilgrim people
We are the church of God
A family of believers, disciples of the Lord
United in one spirit, ignited by the fire
Still burning through the ages
Still present in our lives.

O Comforter to theee we cry
Thou gift of God sent from high
Thou font of life and fire of love
The soul anointing from above
