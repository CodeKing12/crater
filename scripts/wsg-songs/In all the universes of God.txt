In all the universes of God

And all the wondrous things that you've done

There's nothing left to prove you have done it all

You are my universe

We're gonna sing the song of the redeemed

We're gonna sing and shout His praise, we will

TAG
For we are born again

We are Christ's redeemed

For we are Kings and Priests

In His righteousness

Though we be here on earth

We are one with the Lord

We're gonna sing this song of the redeemed
