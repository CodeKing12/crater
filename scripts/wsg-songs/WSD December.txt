I am sick and tired of this lowly life

I am not made for this

I am leaving you too for good

Daddy please...
Daddy don't leave us

Motunrayo,
Mummy

I'll take care of you

Mummy where is your medicine?

The Lord will see us through this
(Amen!)

Have faith in God

Mummy sorry

Oh blood! Mummy, blood

Mummy don't do this

Somebody help, somebody please help me

Mummy...

Mummy Please don't do this
Mummy talk to me

Mummy, mummy please
Mummy talk to me

Oh no!

Mummy wake up
Mummy look at me

Mummy don't leave me alone

No! my mummy is dead
Oh no,

Mummy! mummy!!

Oh death, death, you've done the worst

My dad is gone and now you took my mum away from me

Oh no!
Mummy talk to your daughter

Oh  no, mummy this can't be
Mummy wake up...

Scene two:

He's more than you could ever need

He's more than the eye could see

I don't deserve His love, but He's always been there for me

You see, Jesus met me when I was at my lowest

And if you don't know Jesus, know this:

He's the greatest ensample of

Generosity this world of greed has ever seen

And when Jesus hit the scene, He changed the scenery

And met diversity with serenity

If you're looking for peace, He offers plenty

Jesus was, and Jesus will forever be King

And when the Angels sing,

They sing of the grace that was displayed for sinners like me

I can't explain Him, and I can't describe Him

Because if I could He wouldn't be Jesus

Because you can't explain eternity

And you can't comprehend the galaxies

But it was the loving hands of Jesus, who spun them into existence

And created man, knowing He would go to the cross to pay our sentence

There was a certificate of judgement with a period after the sentence

And we were sentenced to death long before He said, "It is finished"

He's a father to the orphan, a shelter for the homeless

A hiding place for the abused and an anchor for our storms

He stormed the gates of hell and came out on top

And the power of His gospel cannot be stopped

Even when the world tries... and they try a lot

He trade places with Barabbas and became a catalyst

Of missions across the world covering every portion of the atlas

If you're in need of rest, I know of a mattress

If you don't know Jesus, your future is tragic

But He'd gladly embrace tragedy so we
Could live in His presence of majesty

His presence is presents

And it's His presence that presents
Preciousness to a world of peasants

He's far from pretentious, but still loves those who are

He's a light of the world that hung on the stars

He brings the dead to life, but delivers life to the dead

He took a crown of thorns on His head
So we can put crowns at His feet

And I can't wait until the day I get to kiss His feet that were

Nailed to the cross for me, and for you,

And for every other person around the world

He loves the world and I love His word

Because His word became flesh

And in His flesh, He demonstrated the word to the world

He's an example to every boy and every girl

He's a lover of black people; He's a lover of white people

He's a lover of the un-churched
and the assembly under the steeple

He doesn't see the believer's failures;

But still takes time to celebrate their faithfulness

It's His spirit that enables us

And gives us boldness, even when the world labels us

And if you wanna label me

Please call me a "Jesus Freak"

If that freaks you out, good

Because it's better to be good with God

Than to fight being misunderstood

By a world that could never understand

So let it be understood that I don't worship man

I worship Jesus

And although He doesn't need us

He still sees us, and pleads with us

To run to the cross where He bled for us

His heart bleeds for us; His heart grieves for us

But still graciously grants us a pardon for our treason in a season

Where the world tries to explain away

The work of the spirit with human reasoning

And here's the reason why they can't:

Because His spirit is like the wind, and the wind cannot be seen

But loved is he who believes without seeing the unseen

I'm telling you, Jesus is something

He's something more; He's something great

And if you wanna know Him, you don't have to wait

He stands at the narrow path with a key to the gate

And all you have to do is reach out and embrace His grace

I don't care who is president, I have a King who is always present

I don't care who hosts musicals, celebrities;

The voice of the Lord will always be the sweetest melody

I don't care who owns the riches of the globe;

My Jesus has more wealth with more ruby on His robe

I don't care who's the strongest or the fastest;

Nothing matches the creator of the

Universe and His immortal, infinite status

I don't care about religious leaders who died and stay dead

I worship the One who conquered death, and wears a crown on His head

His name is Jesus, and I'm telling you He's something

He was faithful yesterday, He's faithful today

I can feel His presence whenever I pray

And when the time comes for me to fade away

I would remember the day I heard Him say,

"My name is Jesus."
