You Lord, You are worthy
And no one can worship You for me
For all the things You've done for me
And no one can worship You for me

â€¦
All of my worship
Receive my worship
All of my worship
Here's my worship
All of my (all of my worship)
Father, receive my (receive my worship)
All of my worship (all of my worship)
