Praise worship
Deeper in love with you

Jesus hold me close in your embrace
Take me deeper, deeper than I have ever been before

I just want to love you more and more
How I long to be deeper in love

VERSE 2:

Sunrise to sunrise
I will seek your face

Join by your spirit to the promise of your grace

My heart has found you in hope that will abide

Here in your presence forever satisfied.
