I sing to you a high and lofty praise

You flood light me and make me blaze with grace

Oh what a God who can stand against

Your face shines as the sun in all its strength

His power no one ever match

His glory indescribable

His greatness who can deny

And his kingdom never comes to end

Oh oh oh...

You are the Great God

You are God alone

His power no one ever match

His glory indescribable

His greatness who can deny

And his kingdom never comes to end

Oh oh oh...

You are the Great God

You are God alone

Hallelujah...

All the Glory

All the honor

All the Praises

To the wise king

Hallelujah...

All the Glory

All the honor

All the Praises

To the wise king

Hallelujah...
