Corruption brought us here weakening our bones..

A Light meant for hills lies Rusty in the grave..

In Pains of sin and death our  feeble feet were snared to Dance...

Who shall save us from the Tyrants Prison house...Uh uh uh...

Corruption brought us here...A Great one it is...

it shattered our minds

Making us all a living dead

Our Spirits were locked up in the bars of eternal damnation..

No Life...No Grace

But behind the shackles that beclouds our person "our Spirit"

Behind the transgressions that has become a torn in our body

We could tell

By The Ancient of Days himself...Yes we were

as Glorious as God

Yes The Creator of All.. Did Make Us Glorious

By The Power of His Grace He made us Exactly Like Him...

Yes We Were Glorious..Oh oh oh oh oh

So truly Glorious.. Glorious We were

Corruption brought us here...Yes it did..

The Errors of our aged predecessors Adam and Eve...

Eve did it

And Adam followed suit...

altogether corrupting these Gracious Gods that we were.

We were made Glorious

Until that knowledge that leads to DEATH

Cunningly crept in and SQUEEZED LIFE OUT OF US!!!

To Obey is Better than the Fat of Rams..

offered is a Sacrifice...

For To Preserve the Righteous Seed in you...

The Word of God Must prevail...

The Life in us was finally forced out

And straightway WE FELL!! DEAD and became  LIFE LESS...

TEMPLES WITH ETERNITY BUT VOID OF LIFE!!!!

We were perceived as LIVING but the truth is

"WE WERE WALKING DEADS"

All of us! Yes all of us

We were locked up in gross darkness

We didn't even get to know what our

original self looks like...
Could we have been more better than this?

We kept asking this question

Right in the middle of our nothingness,

One Special WORD Came to us...

One  Great Wisdom was given...

Yes! It is a Mystery...

The Love of God found us...

Dying that we may live..

Taking on our transgressions and sin

and nailing them all to the cross..

He Gave us Life! Yes He Did and so;

Unto the King of Kings

we've come to sing Our Praise

For All you Did For Us is Great

Great Great Great

Unto the Father Of Light

we've come to sing Our Praise

For All you Did For Us is Great

Great Great Great

The Life he gave us springs us up

Our Spirits was made alive and for the first time.

We witnessed The beam of Gods Glorious light

Then we adhere to the one that says

At the hearing of this

Our weak bones received Strength

The wisdom of Christ came into us and Power was released

We Stood up as one man and broke off the shackles of Death

We moved Vibrantly from side to side

Oh yes!!! we're free indeed!!!!
We danced and danced and danced to praise our God

As soldiers with no fear we Stamp our feet's with Joy

We lift our voices to Heaven and Shout

"THY WILL BE DONE IN EARTH OH LORD,

AS IT IS IN HEAVEN

FOR WE ARE THINE!!! AMEN!!!

How that we were made just like him!!

We are Gods!!!

We seek him through his Word continually

Yes! In LIFECLASS!

And walks in every paths of the righteous

Our THRONE LIFE

We took trainings

Leadership became our identify

Spiritual Parenting became as honey in our mouth

We kept hearing the Word

And Instructions became more life to us

This is the race we've decided to run,

For our God, we will run all with Great Joy

In the face of affliction

For the Wisdom to overcome all

and Take the World is being given to us

Therefore! WE REIGN
