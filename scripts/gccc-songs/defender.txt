That You've even gone
You come back with the
You come back and You

You go before I know
That You've even gone
Your love becomes my
It leads me from the dry

And all I did was praise
All I did was worship
All I did was bow down
All I did was stay still

Hallelujah, You have
So much better Your
Hallelujah, Great
So much better this way

You know before I do
Where my heart can
Your mercy is the shade
You restore my faith and

And all I did was praise
All I did was worship
All I did was bow down
All I did was stay still

Hallelujah, You have
So much better Your
Hallelujah, Great
So much better this way
Hallelujah, You have
So much better Your
Hallelujah, Great
So much better this way

And When I thought I
You knew where I left me
You reintroduced me to
You picked up all my
Put me back together
You are the defender of


You picked up all my
Put me back together
You are the defender of
And when I thought I lost
You knew where I left me
You reintroduced me to
You picked up all my
Put me back together
You are the defender of
my heart
