SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

Son of man,
Son of righteousness

King of the earth for sinners slain

I was lost,
in darkness found

You randsomed my heart and I will sing

You are my Strength,
my Deliverer

The One who rescued me

You are
my Hope, my redeemer

Your love has set me free

Thats why I will

Bless the Lord,
oh my soul

In the splendor of Your Majesty,

From deep within my spirit sings

Holy Holy

Bless the Lord,
oh my soul
