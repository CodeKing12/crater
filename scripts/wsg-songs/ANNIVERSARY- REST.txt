Rest and remain

Rest and remain on us

Rest and remain

Lord we abide in You

Rest and remain

Rest and remain on us

Rest and remain

Lord we are one with You

You gave Your word and purified my heart

You sent Your spirit and glorified my life

As king and priest to reign upon the earth

And that your kingdom may fill and flood the earth

Remain, Remain on us, Remain
