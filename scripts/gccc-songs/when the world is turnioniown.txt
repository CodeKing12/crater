Ever since you called my name
I have not been the same
You picked me up
And made my heart brand new
Ever since you took my hands
Oh I am changed
My life
A whole new look

So when the world is turnioniown
Turnioniown oh oh
I won
So when the world is turnioniown
Turnioniown oh oh
I won

I won
I won
I won
I won

I live I live I live in you
I live I live I live in you

So when the world is turnioniown
Turnioniown oh oh
I won

I won
I won
I won
I won
