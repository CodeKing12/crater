You came to earth,

you came to die for me

Thank you my papa

You gave yourself,

you gave your only son

You gave me joy,

you gave your HOLYGOST

Thank you my papa

You made me light

and I'm one with you

Thank you my Father

You be my papa,

my surest Father

I go lay my life down for you,

now and forever
