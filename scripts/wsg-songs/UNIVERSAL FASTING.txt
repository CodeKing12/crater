verse 1
I've been waiting on the lord

The lord most high

I've been waiting on my king

He will speak and make my life what I ought to be

He has fashioned me in his will

I belong to him

I belong to him

He has made my life brand new

I am one with him

I am one with him

He has made my life beautiful

He has made my life his own

verse 2
I've been praying to the lord

The lord most high

I've been praying to my king

He will speak and make my life what I ought to be

He has fashioned me in his will

chorus
I belong to him

I belong to him

He has made my life brand new

I am one with him

I am one with him

He has made my life beautiful

He has made my life his own

verse 3
I've been looking to the lord

The lord most high

I've been looking to my king

He will speak and make my life what I ought to be

He has fashioned me in his will

chorus
I belong to him

I belong to him

He has made my life brand new

I one with him

I am one with him

He has made my life beautiful

He has made my life his own
