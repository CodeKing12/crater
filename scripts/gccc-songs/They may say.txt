They may say Come on, get over it
Drink, be merry, for tomorrow we die

They may say
Why the hunger?
Why the thirsting?
Why the mourning?
But my soul cries, my soul cries
My soul cries, my soul cries, my soul cries for You

All my tears You hold in a bottle

my soul cries x2
my soul cries for you

Take me to the place where You satisfy
Take me to the river
I'll do anything, God, there is no price
take me to the river

I'll do anything, God, there is no price
take me to the river
