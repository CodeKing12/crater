YOU ARE GREAT

You are great

Lord I am amazed

How You prove Your love for me

And just how far You will go

You sent Your only Son

To give his life for me

I am yours and you love me so

What could I give to repay You

For the grace that You've shown

My heart's overwhelmed with affection for You.

Then sings my soul my Savior God to Thee.

How great Thou art! How great Thou art!

Then sings my soul my Savior God to Thee

How great Thou art! How great Thou art!
