MINISTERING

I've climbed into the highest mountain
looked all around
Couldn't find nobody

I went down into the deepest valley

Searched all around down there
Couldn't find nobody

I went across the deep blue sea
Couldn't find one to compare

To your grace your love
Your mercy

Nobody greater
Nobody greater than you

searched all over
couldn

I looked high and low
still couldn

nobody greater uh uh

nobody greater than you

nobody greater
nobody greater than you

I love you forever

I love you forever lord

We give glory to God
Glory to God

Glory to God
Forever
