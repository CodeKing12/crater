Halelluyah you have won the victory

Halelluyah you have won it all for me

Death could not hold you down

You are the risen king

Seated in majesty

You are the risen king

I don't wanna sing the latest song

I don't want to percolate the crowd

I just wanna make you smile

I don't care who thinks I' m right or wrong

I don't care who tries to calm me down

I just wanna praise you now

You covered me in the midst of it all

You loved me, gave me another chance

You saw my needs when others saw my faults

You forgave me

I don't have to listen for my name

They don't have to walk me down the aisle

I just wanna make you proud

Should I make the hall of fame

Or they save a special seat

I just hope that you

You covered me in the midst of it all

You love me, gave me another chance


You rescued me

I was going to fall, going to fall

You saved me

{So in my life}

In my life

Be glorified (yeah

CHORUS

You get the glory

You get the praise

You take the honor


I just want to say . . . .

Thanks

(I

Thank you

Thank you Lord

Thank you (For everything you've done)
