MINISTERING
MERCY SAID NO

VERSE 1
I was just a child, when I felt the Saviour leading

I was drawn to what I could not understand

And for the cause of Christ, I have spent my days believing

That what He'd have me be, is who I am

As I've come to see the weaker side of me

I realize His grace is what I'll need

When sin demanded justice for my soul

ChoruS
Mercy said no

I'm not gonna let you go

I'm not gonna let you slip away

You don't have to be afraid

Mercy said no

Sin will never take control

Life and death stood face to face

Darkness tried to steal my heart away

Thank You Jesus, Mercy said no


VERSE 2
For God so loved the world, that He sent His Son to save us

From the cross He built a bridge to set us free

Oh, but deep within our hearts, there is still a war that rages

And makes a sacrifice so hard to see

As midnight fell on crucifixion day

The light of hope seemed oh so far away

As evil tried to stop redemption's flow


Chorus
Mercy said no

I'm not gonna let you go

I'm not gonna let you slip away

You don't have to be afraid

Mercy said no

Sin will never take control

Life and death stood face to face

Darkness tried to steal my heart away

Thank You Jesus, Mercy said no

BRIDGE
And now when heaven looks at me

It's through the blood of Jesus

Reminding me of one long ago


Chorus
Mercy said no

I'm not gonna let you go

I'm not gonna let you slip away

You don't have to be afraid

Mercy said no

Sin will never take control

Life and death stood face to face

Darkness tried to steal my heart away

Thank You Jesus, Mercy said no
