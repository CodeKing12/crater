There shall be showers of
This is the promise of love;
There shall be seasons
Sent from the Savior above

Showers of blessing,
Showers of blessing we need;
Mercy-drops round us are
But for the showers we plead.

There shall be showers of
Precious reviving again;
Over the hills and the valleys,
Sound of abundance of rain.

There shall be showers of
Send them upon us, O Lord!
Grant to us now a refreshing;
Come, and now honor Thy

There shall be showers of
O that today they might fall,
Now as to God we
Now as on Jesus we call!

There shall be showers of
If we but trust and obey;
There shall be seasons
If we let God have His way.
