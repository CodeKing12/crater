Hear my cry, o God, attend unto my prayer
From the ends of the earth I will cry unto Thee
When my heart is overwhelmed
Lead me to the Rock that is higher than I
For You have been a shelter for me
A strong tower from the enemy
I will abide in Your presence for ever
I will trust in the cover of Your wings
