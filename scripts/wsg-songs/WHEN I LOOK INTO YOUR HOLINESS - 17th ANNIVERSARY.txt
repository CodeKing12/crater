When I look into Your holiness

When I gaze into Your loveliness

When all things that surround become shadows

In the light of You

When I've found the joy of reaching Your heart

When my will becomes enthroned in Your love

When all things that surround become shadows

In the light of You

I worship you...

I worship you...

One reason I live

Is to worship you

The reason I live

Is to worship you

worship you
