Let Your Light
Let it chase away this darkness
And Your Glory
Let it rub away this shame
And Your Beauty
Let me wear it just like a garment
And Your Praise
Let it be upon my lips

And Your Praise
Let it be upon my lips

And Your burden
let it be upon my heart

let Your Praise
Let it be upon my lips


you are Yahweh
my lover , my redeemer
