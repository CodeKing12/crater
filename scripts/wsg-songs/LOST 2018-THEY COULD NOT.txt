THEY COULD NOT

They looked at Him and saw a simple man

A carpenter with healing in His hands

They saw Him calm a sea and heal a dying man

They saw but could they really understand

They could not, They could not
Though they tried, they could not

He was just a simple carpenter but with healing in His hands

But could they really understand,
they could not

They listened to the teaching that they heard

They wondered at the mystery of His word

They wondered what He meant, about a Father's plan

They heard but could they really understand

They could not, They could not
Though they tried, they could not

They listened to the teaching about a Father's plan

But could they really understand, they could not

So finally upon a rugged cross

They killed the man who would not suffer loss

And when at last they took what willingly He gave

He died,
but could they keep Him in the grave

They could not,
They could not Praise God,
they could not

And when at last they took from Him what willingly He gave

Could they keep Him in the grave,
could they keep Him in the grave
Could they keep Him in the grave...

They could not,
They could not Praise God,
they could not

And when at last they took from Him what willingly He gave

Could they keep Him in the grave,
could they keep Him in the grave
Could they keep Him in the grave,

They could not...
