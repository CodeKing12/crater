Dreams long dead,
Give up they said
But my father said
There is hoooope

Sons and daughters
To that dead thing
Speak my life
And my breath Will revive

May your beauty
be upon us
Let dry bones
live again

Let your waters
refresh me
Let the old
be new again.

May your waters
refresh me
Let the old
be new again.

When your Spirit comes
We will never be the same.
Your rain is refreshing Your

Breathe of heaven
Awestruck wonder
Who gives life to life itself

All is beauty
Even ashes
You bring colour to my life

Renewed again
Refreshed again
Renewed again
I'm alive again
