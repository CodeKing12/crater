I'll sing a new song to the Lord

I'll bask in your spirit evermore

for your word and wisdom now and evermore

it's a new song and season

in this season i'm spreading

with a new song (Word)

it's a new season

with this new song (Word)

I activate my testimonies

with a new song (Word)

it's a new worship to the Lord

New word new season

New word new wisdom

Word

Wisdom

Honour

Glory

All belong to you Forevermore

it belongs to you

All belong to you  forevermore
