When I think of all you

Mere words are not enough

To express, how I feel inside

Oh Lord, oh Lord

Thank you Lord

Thank you

Im alive brecause you died for me

Your blood you shed on calvary

Unconditional love you have for me

Is si great, for the world to see

You didn

But you chose to die

So I can live
