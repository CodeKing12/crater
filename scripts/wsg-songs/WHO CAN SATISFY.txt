MINISTERING
WHO CAN SATISFY

Who can satisfy my soul like you do

Who on earth can comfort me and love me like You do

Who could ever be more faithful and true

I will trust in You, My God


There is a fountain

Who is the King

Victorious warrior

And Lord of everything

My Rock My Shelter

My very own

Blessed Redeemer

Who reigns above the throne



Who could ever be more faithful and true

I will trust in You

I will trust in You

I will trust in You, My God
