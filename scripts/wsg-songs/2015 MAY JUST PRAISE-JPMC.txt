MINISTERING
HAPPY DAY

Joyous day in history

Death is beaten you have rescued me

Sing it loud Jesus is alive

He emptied cross

He emptied grave

Live eternal you have won that day

Shout it loud Jesus is alive
He's alive

Oh happy day
Oh happy day

you was my sins away

Oh happy day
Oh happy day

I'll never be the same
Forever I am change
