I'm not all about the
I'm not all about the
Everytime I'm in your
I have peace
I have joy
I have love

There is peace where you
There is love where you
There is joy

Something sweeter
Something better
With you

Something sweeter
Something better
With you

I don't wanna go
Outside of your
I just wanna live within
I don't wanna go
Outside of your
Your Glory is All I long
