If praise is the charge
And worship is my offence
Then I'm guilty
so very guilty

I'm a praise
Praise supplier
And I deal
I deal in worship

It's your praise
It's your praise
I will sing
All of my days
All of my days
I will sing your praise

It's your praise
It's your praise
we will sing
All of my days
All of my days
we will sing your praise
