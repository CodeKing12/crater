When the saviour was on the earth

He died for us by his blood

We are redeemed now we are one

With our Lord

Yes we know we are the ones sent to take the world

We know we know

We know

The highest king will reign on earth

His name is Jesus Christ

The one who died to reconcile

Us with our God

Yes we know we are the ones sent to take the world

We know we know

We know

The Precious blood of Christ

That was shed on the cross

Has made us kings and priests

To our God

Yes we know we are the ones sent to take the world

We know we know

We know
