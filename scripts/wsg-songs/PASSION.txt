Your word has given me a brand new life

Your Word has given me a brand new Spirit

Your Word your life is all I have

Your Spirit is all I know is all I have in me

You are my breath

You are my Life

You are my Passion

Oh how I love to lift my hands to you

As a sacrifice of praise

Oh how I love to bow down to you

As a sign of surrender
