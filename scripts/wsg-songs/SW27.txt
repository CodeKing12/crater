PRAISES:

These are the days of Elijah

Declaring the word of the Lord yeah

And these are the days of your servant Moses
Righteousness being restored

These are the days of great trials

Of famine and darkness and sword

Still we are the voice in the desert crying

Prepare ye the way of the Lord

Behold He comes riding on the clouds

Shinning like the sun at the trumpet

Lift your voice year of Jubilee

Out of Zion

There is no God like Jehovah
