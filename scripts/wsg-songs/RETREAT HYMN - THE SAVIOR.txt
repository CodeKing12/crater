Verse
When the saviour was on the earth
He died for us by his blood

We are redeemed now we are one
With our Lord

Yes we know we are the ones sent to take the world

Chorus
We know we know
We know we know

We know we know
We know

Verse
The highest king will reign on earth
His name is Jesus Christ

The one who died to reconcile
Us with our God

Yes we know we are the ones sent to take the world
