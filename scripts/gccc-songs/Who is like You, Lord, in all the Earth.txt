Nothing in this world will
Jesus, You're the cup that

Your presence is heaven to
Your presence is heaven to

Who is like You, Lord, in all
Matchless love and beauty,
Nothing in this world will
Jesus, You're the cup that

Treasure of my heart and of
In my weakness, You are
Redeemer of my past and
You're the holder of my future
