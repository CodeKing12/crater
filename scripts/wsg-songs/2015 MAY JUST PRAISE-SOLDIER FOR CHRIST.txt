SOLDIER FOR CHRIST
MINISTERING
WORSHIP MEDLEY

You are the reason

Why I lift my hands

Why I lift my voice

Why I sing to you

You are the reason

I'm alive today

I am here to say

It's all because of you

You are the reason

Savior, ruler, Jesus
You are the reason

I

I will show forth your beauty

If I dance it won

If I shout it won

Chorus
For you are the great and mighty king

You rule in every nation

On Christ the solid rock

You are worthy to be praise

You are alpha and omega, I worship you today

In you I put my trust, your name I will exalt

Heaven speak of your glory

And the earth of your beauty

Your love is new every minuet

And your faithfulness is ever sure

Chorus
For you are the great and mighty God

So worthy to be praised

You

You are the joy of the whole world
