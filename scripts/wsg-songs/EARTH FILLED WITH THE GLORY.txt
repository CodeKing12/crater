Jesus has taught me many things
Christ has shown me many things

For the earth shall be filled
Filled with the glory

For the earth shall be filled
The Glory of the Lord

As the waters the sea
As the waters the sea

Gave his son so we have life
And have it abundantly

For as many have received he gave the
Call to   preach the  word

And with everything that we are we sing
All the praise we bring to you our king

Let the nations see
All your promises

As your glory is revealed in us

And with everything that we are we sing
All the praise we bring to you our king

Let the nations see
All your promises

As your glory is revealed in us

And the earth will ring
As your praise we sing

As your glory fills the atmosphere

Evry knee shall bow
Evry tongue confess

That your name will reign in all the earth
