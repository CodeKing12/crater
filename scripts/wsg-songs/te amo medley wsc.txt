I'm a living, breathing, walking, talking, Moving miracle

People say I'll never

They say I'll never ever

But stop, look, watch

Cause I am...

Compared to him who lives in Me and knows all things

Greater is HE than what you See

Te amo, I love you

With all my soul oh senor

I love you LORD

Te amo, Te amo

I love you LORD
