Fearfully, wonderfully

Made in the image of Abba

I am free completely

Safe in the arms of my Father

I am royalty

I am who You called me

I believe I am Yours

Oh, yes, I am

Fearfully, wonderfully

Made in the image of Abba

I am free completely

Safe in the arms of my Father

I am royalty ( ah... ah...)

I am who You called me

I believe (I believe)

I am Yours

Like a brush in the hands of an artist

I am Your masterpiece

A thought before life everstarted

You took Your time on me

I'm royalty (Oh yeah)

My Father is King

I believe (I believe)

I am Yours

Woah

Hey! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I know who I am

Ah, yeah

You made me on purpose

And I am Your favorite

You made me, yeah (On purpose)

And I am (And I am)

Your favorite (Your favorite)

Help me to see everything You see in me

I'm royalty, all that You have

created me to be I'm Yours

You took Your time on me, yeah (You took Your time on me)

You took Your time on me (You took Your time on me)
