Oya lift him up
Higher........



I feel like dancing

I feel like shouting

I feel like jumping



Ebami poruko re
Emini tinje emini oloruko nla

Emini mase beru

Oloruko nla nla nla
Oyigiyigiyigiyigi kabiosi

Oba to to to to tokari aye
Emini, emini emini maseberu



When you see me dance I dance as a winner man o

Somebody say baba
Baba...



I will bless the Lord

Oh my soul and all that is within me,
bless his holy name



Lord you're worthy of the glory,
and the honour Hallelujah!





Yes there were times in my life
When I thought I would never make it

I almost went down I was out
for the count I was through

But it was then when I thought
it would end That I stood up again

What hell had for evil God
turned it around for my good

The devil thought he (had me)
Thought that my life was (over)

Give up

More

Situation

Begun........He turned it!

He turned it!



Shout hallelujah to the lord....

Hallelujah to the lord
