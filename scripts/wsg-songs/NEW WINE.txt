NEW WINE

VERSE
In the crushing, in the pressing

You are making new wine

In the soil I, now surrender

You are breaking new ground

BRIDGE
So I yield to You and to Your careful hand

When I'm one with You, I don't need to understand

Make me Your vessel, make me an offering

Make me whatever You want me to be

CHORUS
I came here with nothing but all You have given me

Jesus, bring new wine out of me

VERSE
In the crushing, in the pressing

You are making new wine

In the soil I, now surrender

You are breaking new ground

Make me Your vessel, make me an offering

Make me whatever You want me to be

BRIDGE
I came here with nothing but all You have given me

Jesus, bring new wine out of me

BRIDGE 2
Where there is new wine

There is new power

There is new freedom

The Kingdom is here

I lay down my old flames

To carry Your new fire today

BRIDGE
Make me Your vessel, make me an offering

Make me whatever You want me to be

God, I came here with nothing but all You have given me

Jesus, bring new wine out of me
