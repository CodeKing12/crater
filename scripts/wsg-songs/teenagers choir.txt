CHIOR MINISTERING
BEATITUDE

VERSE 1
I donn't look at any situation all I want to do is to give
God praise

Never look at what I wonna do all I wonna do is to open the gate

Not that I didn't really care but what should be done
should be done without late

He who stay inside of me is greater than he in this world

The bible tells me not to worry so

I don't need to go nor travel to Warri

Though times I think of money
But surely Joy come in greater Morning

So let me put God first and every thing would be added to me

Those who don't know god are the ones always found worrying

Beatitude..... hu hu beatitude

BRIDGE
Blessed are those who are poor in spirit
Cos heaven belongs to them

Blessed are people who mourn
God will make them comfortable

Happy are the humble ones
They will recieve God's promice

Blessed are the poor in earth
For they will see the lord god

I know am bleesed......
Beatitude.....
