'I WON'T GO BACK'

I've been changed, healed, freed, delivered

I've found joy, peace, grace and favor

And right now

right now is the moment

Today is the day

I've been changed
I've been changed

I have waited for this moment to come

And I won't let it pass me by...

I won't go back,

I can't go back,

to the way it used to be

Before your presence came and changed me

All  my  shame, guilt, sins forgiven

No more  chains, fear, My past  is over

Right now is the moment

Today is the day

I've been changed
I've been changed

I have waited for this moment to come

And I won't let it pass me by...

Ah....

I won't go back,

I can't go back,

To the way it used to be

Before your presence came and changed me

Never going back, to the way it was

Never going back I am never going back

I won't go back,

I can't go back,

to the way it used to be

Before your presence came and changed me

Never going back I am never going back

Never going back to the way it was
