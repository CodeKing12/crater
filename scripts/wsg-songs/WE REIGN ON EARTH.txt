VERSE
As we're casting our crowns at your feet

We lay our lives at the Altar of your grace

Have your way

So we give our hearts to your Word

So your kingdom can fully reign on earth

This is your place

CHORUS
Thy kingdom come, Thy will is done

We are in you, We reign on earth

Lord in you, Yes we reign

BRIDGE
You are my Word, You are my Joy

You are my Peace, You are my Life

In your Word there is Life

In your Word there is Hope

In your Word there is Power

In your Word there is Confidence

Your Word my home, Your Word my life

Your Word my wealth, Your Word my all
