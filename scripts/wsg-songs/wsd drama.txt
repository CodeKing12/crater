Call me Doctor Dare now

King:
There is power in the blood of Jesus

There is healing in the blood of the lamb

There is power in the blood of Jesus

There's healing in the blood of the lamb.

Doctor Dare:
My King what has happened?

Queen:
Doctor Dare, we have to help my child

King:
What happened to her? Doctor Dare I hope all is well

Doctor Dare:
It's shocking my king but we have lost her.

King:
That not Possible

Queen:
No o

King:
Woman, keep quiet

I don't know what you are saying neither do I believe.

Today is the day of joy in my family and town...

God never showed this to me

Great is Thy faithfulness O God my Father

There is no shadow of turning with Thee

Thou changest not, Thy compassions, they fail not

As Thou hast been Thou forever wilt be

Queen:
Why is this always happening to me?

Why me?

My only surviving child out of six children

God No!

Doctor Dare:

My Queen, please be calm

King:
Doctor Dare you have been my friend from childhood

You are my Doctor and my Pastor

Look at what has happened to me.

Doctor Dare:
I understand My King

But we just need to trust in God for a miracle

Queen:
Have I not been trusting God enough?

Ever since I started losing my children

Have I not trusted God enough

King:
I dedicated this throne and my kingship to God.

I have been serving him truthfully but

Doctor Dare:
Trust and obey

For there's no other way

To be happy in Jesus

But to trust and obey.

King:
But we have been trusting

We have been praying

In the history of this throne

Nobody has ever served God as I have.

Queen:
God have mercy on me

King:

Before I ascended the throne due to my western education

and exposure I have known God

I have made sacrifices

sowed seeds to take away every evil ordinances

and covenants of my forefathers

that ascended this throne before I did.

Queen:
And now because you didn't follow on their ways

It has cost us our children.

King:
I have not forsaken the Lord

neither do I served other gods.

Doctor Dare:
For the LORD will not forsake his people

For his great name's sake

because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people

Doctor Dare:
If truly you have kept your Covenant and vows.

Then let's use the Blood of the lamb

because it never fails.

Lord Almighty thank you for my King and his kingdom.

He has dedicated his life, his throne

and this kingdom in your name.

He is a faithful steward, he loves you,

he did not follow the evil ways of his Predecessors

that never finds you.

Instead he seek and trusted you the Lord.

LORD will you allow the wicked accusers

merry over his household?

It is time to defend your own.

LORD show us your Greatness.

We believe In the blood of the lamb,

Now every evil ordinances is blotted out

we receive a Miracle now in your name LORD!

Song: To God be the glory, great things He hath done,

So loved He the world that He gave us His Son,

Who yielded His life our redemption to win,

And opened the life-gate that all may go in

Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,

Let the earth hear His voice;

Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,

Let the people rejoice;

Oh, come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,

And give Him the glory; great things He hath done.
