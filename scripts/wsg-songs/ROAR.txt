Chorus
Let the army Roar, Hey Hey

Verse
An army is rising,

That won

If we must have You,

Nothing less than all of You

Bridge
Because we won

We are right where You are

We

Nothing less than that

We won

We are right where You are

We

Nothing less than all


Chorus
Let the army Roar, Hey Hey

Verse
An army is rising,

That won

If we must have You,

Nothing less than all of You

Bridge
Because we won

We are right where You are

We

Nothing less than that

We won

We are right where You are

We

Nothing less than all

Bridge
Our generation shall praise Your Name

Our generation shall praise, Shall praise Your Name

Let the army Roar, Hey Hey


Verse 2
Devil over this generation you are a loser

We take it back

We redeem the time

They won

A fire goes before them

Behind them is a desolate land

They won

And it shall come to pass

In the last days that I will pour out My Spirit upon all flesh

And your sons and daughters they shall prophesy

They shall see visions

Bridge 2

And He shall reign, Forever and ever
