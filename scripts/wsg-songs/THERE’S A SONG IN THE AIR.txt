THERE

VERSE 1
There
There
There
And a baby
And the stay rains its fire
While the beautiful sing
For the manger of Bethlehem
Cradles a king

VERSE 2
There
O
For the virgin
Is the Lord of the earth
Ay! The star rains its fire
While the beautiful sing
For the manger of Bethlehem
Cradles a king

VERSE 3
In the light of that star
Lie the ages impearled
And that song from afar
Has swept over the world
Every heart is aflame
And the beautiful sing
In the homes of the nations
That Jesus is king

VERSE 4
We rejoice in the light
And we echo the song
That comes down through the night
From the heavenly throng
Ay! We should to the lovely
Evangel they bring
And we great in his cradle
Our Saviour and King.
