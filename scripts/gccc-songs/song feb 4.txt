The splendour of our king
Clothe in majesty
Let all the earth rejoice
Let all the earth rejoice

He wraps himself in light
And darkness tries to hide
And trembles at his voice
And trembles at his voice

How great is our God
Sing with me how great
How great is our God

You're the name above all names
You are worthy of my praise
My heart will sing how great is our God

Light of world, you stepped down into darkness
You've opened my eyes, now I see
You're the beauty that makes this heart adore you
Hope of the life spent with him

I'll never know how much it cost to see my sin,
upon the cross.


So, here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down
Here I am to say that you're my God
You're altogether worthy
All together lovely
wonderful to me.
