MINISTERING
BIG

Am starting strong
There is direction for me

The Holy Spirit leads my path
Hallelujah I reign

Am stronger in faith
Stronger in love

Am increasing in grace
This is the morning of my life

I see me taking my place
I see me in picture of Your word

I see me moving forward
Taking over the world

By His Spirit
By His Spirit

Taking over the world

By the power of the Holy Ghost

I maintain my glow
Cos am born of God

The Holy Spirit leads my path
Hallelujah I reign

I maintain my glow
Cos am born of God

The Holy Spirit leads my path
Hallelujah I reign

I see me taking my place
I see me in the picture of Your word

I see me moving forward
Taking over the world

By the power of the Holyghost
Of the Holyghost of the Holyghost

Taking over the world
By the power of the Holyghost

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Taking over the world

Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
Taking over the world

I see You
Taking Your place

I see You in the picture of His world
I see You moving forward

Taking over the world
I see You
