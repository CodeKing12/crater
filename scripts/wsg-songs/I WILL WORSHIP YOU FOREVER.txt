MINISTERING
THIS GOD IS TOO GOOD

verse 1
I know a God, who's merciful and kind,

Faithful and gracious

I'm the apple of His eyes

The thought that fills His heart

Every Morning, noon and night

He loved me when I didn't care

And was patient till I came

Running back into His arms

Look how He turned my life around

Made me a shining star

His glory to reveal

chorus
I will worship Him forever

Love Him forever because

My God is too good oh

I will worship Him forever

Love Him forever because

My God is too good oh

verse 2
Don't look too far to see
How good He is,

Just look at me

He took me from the miry clay

Set my feet upon the rock

I'm standing in his righteousness

He took away my sin and shame

Gave me a brand new name

His beloved and His redeemed

Look how He turned my life around

Made me a shining light

His glory to reveal

chorus
I will worship Him forever

Love Him forever because

My God is too good oh

I will worship Him forever

Love Him forever because

My God is too good oh

I will worship Him forever

Love Him forever because

My God is too good oh

chorus
I will worship Him forever

Love Him forever because

My God is too good oh

Jesus You're too good oh

Jesus You're too much oh

His grace is too much oh

His love is so deep oh

I do deserve
(I do deserve )

But I am grateful
(Always)

I do deserve it
(No no)

But You love me anyway

So I worship You forever

Love You forever

This God is too good oh

See what You've done for me

See how You set me free

How You washed me in Your precious blood Jesus

CHORUS
I will worship Him forever

Love Him forever because

This God is too good oh

I will worship Him forever

Love Him forever because

This God is too good oh

You are too good oooh

He's so good Jesus

You're too good oh

Wonderful

Glorious Jesus
