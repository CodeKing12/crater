Draw me close to you
Never let me go
I lay it all down again
To hear you say that I'm
You are my desire
No one else will do
'Cause nothing else can
To feel the warmth of your
Help me find the way
Bring me back to you

You're all I want
You're all I've ever needed
You're all I want
Help me know you are near
