God gave his word
God kept his word The saviour came

Died rose he's alive Salvation guaranteed
Don't keep this to yourself

(Go tell it)

He keeps his word He always does
If he's done it before He can do it again

Just wait and see and while you wait

(Go tell it)

His word is yea and amen,
Yes you can take it to the bank

And no this is not a prank

(Go tell it)

From City to city
Industry company

Don't you know we're there for a reason
Let them hear je komo

(Go tell it)

The Kingdom is here
Christ is at the door

Certainly I go make heaven
But definitely it'd be nice to see you there

Tell bola and bisi
Chinma and chichi

Make we go with as many as can be
What was spoken will never be broken

He's coming again for his people
First he came as a baby, But now as a king

Chorus
Go tell it on the mountain
Go tell it

He's coming again
But before then, Your eyes will see

What he has spoken to the,
Keep the faith hope alive

Abeg please tell me you believe

Chorus
Go tell it on the mountain
Go tell it

What was spoken will never be broken

He's coming again for his people,

That time na baby Jesus
But now king Jesus naim you go see

Go tell it f'araye
Go, go tell it: e so f'araye, Go tell it

What was spoken will never be broken
He's coming again for his people

That time na baby Jesus
But now king Jesus naim you go see
