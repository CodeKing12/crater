HOD DEBORAH
MINISTERING
"SPEAK THE NAME"

SLIDE 1

The atmosphere is changing

Nothing stays the same

Heaven is waiting

For the mention of the Name

The Spirit is moving

Burning like a flame

Healing the broken

By the One we proclaim

INTRO
Raise it up

Fill the sky

Chains will fall

Mountains move

We lift Him high

BRIDGE

Speak the Name

The Name above all other names

Speak the Name

The Name the wind and waves obey

All of heaven's coming down

Fill the earth with the sound

Of the Name

The Name of Jesus

Gather all who wonder.....

Hostages of shame.....

Miracles unfolding

At the mention of the Name

The darkness is fleeing

Mercy raining  down

Healing waters flowing

As our lips make the sound

Raise it up

Fill the sky

Chains will fall

Mountains move

We lift Him high

SLIDE 2

The Name above all other names

Speak the Name

The Name the wind and waves obey

All of heaven's coming down

Fill the earth with the sound

Of the Name

The Name of Jesus

Speak the Name

The Name of Jesus

SLIDE 3

Oh oh oh oh....

Strongholds are broken

I've been made free

I am forgiven

Fear has to leave

Strongholds are broken

I've been made free

I am forgiven

Fear has to leave

Your Name is healing

Your Name is power

Your Name is holy

My strong, strong tower

Wonderful Name

Glorious Name

Powerful Name  of   Jesus Jesus
