I SAW GOD

I saw God the other day

She looked like you
He looked like me

Now I

And this one you can repeat

I saw God the other day

Just walking down the street

He said
“

“
“

I don

I know who I saw
And it was God!

I said

“

She gave me a simple answer
She said,

“
“

“

He said

“
You know a few of my puzzle pieces are missin

And She said,

“

“
I mean the people I despise.

He said,

When you see Me in their eyes!

I don

I know Who I saw
And it was God

I saw God the other day

She looked like you
He looked like me

Now I spoke to God that day
And you spoke to Him, too

And He told me that of all the miracles ever created

“

Now that you

Can you tell me

She said,
But it

Well now my eyes are open

And I can clearly see
That all the things I paid for in life

I could have gotten for free!

Now I

And you might wanna think this through

She said,
Then tell me, Who are you????

I saw God the other day

She looked like you
He looked like me
