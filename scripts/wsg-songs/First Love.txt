I'm returning to the secret place
Just an altar and a flame

Love is found here in our sacred space
I hear Your voice, I see Your face

You're still my first love
You're still my only one


There's a table just for You and me
Break the bread and pour the wine

Perfect union, nothing in between
I am Yours and You are mine

You're still my first love
You're still my only one

I feel my heart beating out of my chest
I wanna stay forever like this

May the flame of my heart always be lit
I wanna burn forever like this



You're still my first love
You're still my only one


I feel my heart beating out of my chest
I wanna stay forever like this

May the flame of my heart always be lit
I wanna burn forever like this

Oh, forever like this
Forever, forever, forever like this

Forever like this, forever like this, woah


Oh, Your love for me is great

Your love, Your love

Your love is wild
Your love is wild for me



I feel my heart beating out of my chest
I wanna stay forever like this

May the flame of my heart always be lit
I wanna burn forever like this
