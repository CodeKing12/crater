If I start to talk all the things wey
baba God don do for me, e no go finish

You died so I could live
Your love no be make believe

You dwell inside of me
Yes, your love has captured me

Am in love ooo
Am in love ooo

If I start to talk all the things wey baba God don do for me
e no go finish

Lord am here today, and it's by your love
Not like yesterday, not who I was before...

You came and change me from the inside out
You put a new song to sing in my mouth

I sing for you every song I can
My feet must move any dance I can

You  gave to me everything I have
I give to you everything I am.
