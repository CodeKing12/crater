VIA DOLAROSA

Down the via dolarosa in Jerusalem that day

The soldiers tried to clear the narrow street

But the crowd pressed in to see the man condemned to die on calvary

He was bleeding from a beating

There were stripes upon his back

And he wore a crown of thorns upon his head

And he bore with every step the scorn of those who cried out for his death

Down the via dolorosa

Called the way of suffering

Like a lamb came the Messiah, Christ the King

But he chose to walk that road out of his love for you and me

Down the via dolorosa

All the way to calvary

Por la via dolorosa

Triste dia en jerusalen

As soldados le abrian paso a Jesus

Mas la genta se acercba

Para ver al que lievaba li acrus

Por la via dolorosa

Que es la via dolor

Como veja vino cristo rey senor

Y fue el quie ti posi amor por ti por mi

Por la vioa dolorosa

Al calvario y a morir

The blood that will cleanse

The souls of all men

Made it's way through the heart of Jerusalem

Down the via dolorosa

Called the way of suffering

Like a lamb came the Messiah, Christ the King

But he chose to walk that road out of his love for you and me

Down the via dolorosa

All the way to calvary
