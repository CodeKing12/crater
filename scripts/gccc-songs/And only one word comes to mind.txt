And only one word comes to
There's only one word to

Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty
Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty

There is no one like You
You are holy, holy

Just one look on Your face
Just one glance of Your eyes
My whole world is changed
My whole world is changed

Oh I seek only to see Your
I don't wanna go anywhere
Without Your presence

Oh let me see Your face
The beauty of Your holiness
Take me into the holy place
