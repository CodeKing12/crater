Giver of Life
I haven't been the same
Ever since that day I called your name
Yahweh Yahweh look what you've


What can i do for you my Lord?
I want you to know my heart is yours
It's not the question of what you can
But what can i do for you my Lord?


Up to your cross I crawl
Now I am standing ten feet tall
Jesus my savior look what you've


Free at last i'm free
I owe you my life completely
Yahweh Yahweh, look what you've


You will do, what only you can do
You will say, what only you can say

Come and do, what only you can do
Come and say what only you can say

Life oh life
Giver of Life

Your word is life

Peace oh Peace oh Peace
Giver of Peace
Peace oh peace
Your word is Peace

Joy oh Joy
Giver of Joy
Joy oh Joy

You give peace where there is no

Your word is life/2ce
