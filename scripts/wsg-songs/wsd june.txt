Hallowed be your name

With open hands we say (we lift our voices and say), Hallowed be Your Name

Whatever comes our way, (we lift our voices and say), Hallowed be Your Name

The One who is to come, (we lift our voices and say), Hallowed be Your Name

The Beginning and the End, (we lift our voices and say), Hallowed be Your Name

Jesus, Jesus, You

Take a look at me, look at me, The one You saved, Hallowed be Your Name

Trust and obey

Verse 1

When we walk with the Lord, In the light of His Word,

What a glory He sheds on our way; While we do His good will,

He abides with us still, And with all who will trust and obey.

Chorus

Trust and obey,For there

Not a shadow can rise, Not a cloud in the skies,

But His smile quickly drives it away; Not a doubt or a fear,

Not a sigh or a tear, Can abide while we trust and obey.

Chorus

Trust and obey,For there

Verse 3

Not a burden we bear, Not a sorrow we share,

But our toil He doth richly repay; Not a grief or a loss,

Not a frown or a cross, But is blest if we trust and obey.

But we never can prove, The delights of His love,

Until all on the altar we lay; For the favor He shows,

And the joy He bestows,Are for them who will trust and obey.

Verse  5

Then in fellowship sweet,  We will sit at His feet,

Or we

Where He sends, we will go, Never fear, only trust and obey.

Eleda mi ko oun ti o da o (My destiny forbids bad things), Ori mi koya (My destiny forbids suffering)

Try to be obedient child, Be obedient, be obedient

Try to be obedient child, Never you disobey.
