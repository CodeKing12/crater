Your grace, Your grace has found me just as I am (2x)
Empty handed but alive in Your hands
We're singing Majesty, we're singing Majesty
Forever I am changed by Your love
In the presence of Your Majesty

We're singing Majesty, we're singing Majesty
Forever, forever I am changed by Your love
In the presence of Your Majesty
We're singing Majesty, Majesty
