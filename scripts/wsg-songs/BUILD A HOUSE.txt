MINISTERING
BUILD A HOUSE

intro
With my hands I build a house

With my heart I let Him in

With my praise I build a house

With my worship I let Him in

verse1
Cause when I lift my hands up I see

Nothing can intimidate you or me

Who the son set free is free indeed

The heart of a worshipper

Is the heart that will give you praise

Cause when I lift my hands up it appears

Worries dissipate with all my fears

I reverence you inside
my tears, oh

The heart of a worshipper

Is the heart that will give you praise

verse2
When I lift my hands up I bow

My harvest I

Unto thee I made a vow

The heart of a worshipper

Is the heart that will give you praise

verse3
When I lift my hands up I know

as a worshipper am never alone

You

The heart of a worshipper

Is the heart that will give you praise

With my hands I build a house

With my worship I let Him in

With my praise I build a house

With my worship I let Him in

Let Him in
Let Him in.
