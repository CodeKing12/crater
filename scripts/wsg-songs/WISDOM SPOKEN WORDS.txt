I am a field with the most costly treasure,
A kingdom with the most mighty King,
A Heaven with the most hallowed God.
His name is WISDOM, Yes the wisdom of God.

He's a Father, I'm not without commandments.

She's a Mother, I'm not without love.
He's a brother, I'm not without a guide.
She's a sister, I'm not without a care.
She's a friend I'm not without Joy.
True wisdom lives in me; I'm nothing less than perfection.

Wisdom is a SPIRIT; It's principal name is PARENTHOOD
It purges the humble and
Edifies the simple.
It moulds the crumbled
And Beautifies the dreadful
He reaches out to the lust-lost souls
And crowns their hearts with love.

A heart seasoned with the understanding of life
definitely has WISDOM as its instructor..
He's a Teacher, She's a Mentor
SH-HE's the Single wholeness of Fatherhood and Motherhood
The demeanor of the Godhead..

I am WISDOM, "She Says"
The glorious flower that blossoms
In the kingdom once called the domain of doom.

-WISDOM calls me out of folly;
The Nations desolate realm.
-WISDOM teaches my hands to be skillful;
Before the time the heathen lacks
-WISDOM teaches my mouth to speak of mysteries unknown
For to save the Nations Souls

-WISDOM teaches my eyes to see
What steps his Will demands

-WISDOM teaches my heart to Love
The ones the world detests
And then he teaches my leg to run
The kingdom race till the finish line.

-Oh! WISDOM, Yes God's WISDOM,
How great thou art..

I "WISDOM" stand sure
Never changing, from the Alpha of life to the Omega of it..
I remain an eternal salt;
Giving sweet taste to the heart that loves to seek my grace..
I am a treasured Crown of peerless worth..
To every head that heeds my instructions..

Your Majesty is fearful,
Your Royalty is Love,
Your Capacity is greatness,
Your bowels are full of life..
You're like the farthest of heights,
An endless of Depths-- Vast in space,
Great in Majesty...Oh! WISDOM , Yes! WISDOM..the WISDOM of God..


Yes! I am Gods WISDOM!!!
