Majesty

your grace has found me just as I am

and you draw me by the light in your hand

Majesty

forever I am changed by your love

in the presence of your majesty

Open the flood gate in abundance

let it regin upon me

Baba o

You know that I love

You know that I want to know you so much more

More than I have before

These words are from my heart

These words are not made up

I will live for you
I am devoted to you

King of majesty

I have one desire

Just to be with you my Lord

Jesus you are the saviour of my soul

And forever and ever I'll give my praises to you
