Jesus you're the sweetest name of all

Jesus you always hear me when I call

Jesus you are my glory and my all

You're the sweetest sweetest name of all

Wonderful and marvelous is  Jesus Christ to me

Sweeter than the honey in the honeycomb is He,

Jesus is real
He will never fail

I will praise Him now and throughout all eternity
