GLORY

CHORUS

I praise you Lord for your glory

Verse 1

I've been wanting you for Days

And I promise i'mma run with you in every race

All i need is the strenght and the lasting grace

I ain't never wanna loose like a shoe lace

You got salvation i need it

To preach to the world so they can believe

And their souls again shall be living

So you'll be the one they'll believe in

Ok Brethren! my world needs the lord

I'm his son and not a Fan, God show me your love

He gives me power not a gen, Bring me the light

Your word is all i wanna learn, Teach me the right

I need direction be my Compass

Make dem devil never come to me to trespass

I ain't wanna be down like the green grass

I need more of you lord not a thing less

CHORUS

I praise you Lord for your glory

Verse 2

I need to do more than you came to do

Cause that is my mission

To let the world know what they've come to do

Is to apply some Dedication

We need to drive souls, and save souls

So we'll make it to heaven

Our place is not a pit, nor a big hole

Watch out for the trap of the Devil

You shouldn't fall, allow God to reign

Let him flow in you even in your Veins

We gotta be pure, he shouldn't find a Stain

Follow God and he'll break all the Chains

God we need more of you in our lives

More of your spirit and less of life

You got the keys and you got the Drive

Your ways are smooth for once they never been Rough
