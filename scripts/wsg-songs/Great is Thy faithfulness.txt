There is no shadow of turning with Thee

Thou changest not, Thy compassions, they fail not

As Thou hast been, Thou forever will be.

Morning by morning new mercies I see
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided

Verse 2
Summer and winter, and spring time and harvest,

Sun, moon and stars in their courses above,

Join with all nature in manifold witness
To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.

Verse 3
Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth,

Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide

Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow

Blessings all mine, with ten thousand beside
