And I saw the dead..small and great Stand before God

And the books were opened

And another book was opened

Which is the book of life

And the dead were judged out of those

things which were written in the books

According to their works

The scriptures says their works

What will be said about your works

Because you will be judged by your works

Dis one no be caprison o

He (God)gave to you

The Ministry...the Marriage

And yes.....your children

What will be your report

How will you account for all that he gave you

Sons what will be written in your books

Daughters what will be said of your works

It is time to do more works

It is time to  be accountable

Yea..you will give account of all on the last day.

What will you be judged by?
