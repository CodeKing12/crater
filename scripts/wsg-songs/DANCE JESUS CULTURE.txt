DANCE
JESUS CULTURE

verse1
I
Why should I be still when the worship starts Lord
I
What can men do can

You spin over me, and You are pleased
When I spend myself on You
I
Letting my dance come forth

chorus
Dance, dance
Let the Spirit move you
Dance, dance
Holy Spirit in you

verse2
Turn my mourning into dancing
My heart is full of joy
I will praise You

You healed my body and You made me new
My heart is full of joy
I will dance for you

You gave me love that broke down fear

My heart is full of joy, I will sing to you

Oh My heart is full of joy, I will praise
I will dance, I will sing for You
For You

chorus
Dance, dance
Let the Spirit move you
Dance, dance
Holy Spirit in you
