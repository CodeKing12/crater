MINISTERING
OPEN UP

Out of the mundane

To where I'm ordained

For things that were made

Were made from things unseen

there are realms of glory

for my world to see

dimensions found only

through Jesus Christ the son

channels of my spirit

open up

Let the river flow

i'm one with my father

open up

no boundaries no limits open up

let deep call unto deep open up

open up.....
