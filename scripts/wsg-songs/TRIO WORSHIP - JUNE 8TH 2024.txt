Lord, Your sheer mercy

Flows to all

Slow to anger

Abounding in love

Not for earthly glory

But for Your praise

You created a masterpiece

You created me

Your love is ever sure

And in its steadfastness

It has no end

The glory of Your reign

And the greatness of Your name

It has no end

Great God of love

I know Your faithfulness

It has no end

I'll love You every day with this very life You gave

It has no end
