Have you met the one who froze
Just one touch from him, I
Have you met the king so warm
Yet he is the one who fights for

Have you met the lion and the
Shepherd of my soul yet lamb
Come and taste and see him for

Chorus
Come and see the mighty one
And the great lamb
Come and see ruler of the
Come and see the one Whose
Come and see whose loving
Are holding me.

Bridge
Just a whisper Just a touch Just
your name upon my lips Just a
thought Just your voice Just your
breathe thatGives me life.
