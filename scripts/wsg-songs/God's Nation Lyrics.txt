Ain't no reason that should get me scared

Cuz the Lord is my light and Salvation I know it

Situations try to come my way

But the Lord is my Sheperd I shall not want

You gave me everything that I need

That I need

There's no where else I'll rather be

I'll rather be

No words can contain the gratitude that we bring

That we bring

Heaven is God's Nation

Every Citizen worshipping in adoration

Nations of the world are peruzed by critics

That's the reason that I put my trust in him

Heaven is God's Nation

Every Citizen worshipping in adoration

The Lord is my shepherd so I shall not want

That's the reason that I put my trust in him

I've got the blessings on my inside

I've got the blessings of God

Favour is inside

Blessing is inside

Nothing is outside

Goodness is inside

Prosperity is inside

Capacity is inside

Nothing is outside
