MY WORLD

Oh oh oh oh

I preach for a living

Cause it's one thing that you

commanded me to do

Like the sun I keep shinning oh oh

I'm a city set up on a hill

Ministry is life oh

So I no dey joke

When I tell you say he be my world

No life outside ministry eh eh eh

Witnessing na im be my work

I've got the life of God in me

I'm gonna shine and let them see

Greater is he in me

Nothing go fit to turn my heart from him

I go showcase oh my love for you

You are my world

Nothing compares

Oh oh oh oh

I call you My Ade Ori Ori Ade
(I call you The crown on my head)

Ife Olu Olu Ife
(God of love)

Eleburuike
(The one with abundance of care)
