RESCUED

VERSE
I was lost in need of a saviour

So my soul cried out to you

VERSE
You rescued me You rescued me

You rescued me with your power

VERSE
Hope restored your love found me

Grace was revealed when you saved me

You rescued me You rescued me

You rescued me with all power

VERSE
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

VERSE
Your rescued me....
