I'm coming back to the heart
It's all about you
it's all about you Jesus
I'm sorry Lord for the things
It's all about you
it's all about you Jesus

It's all about you
It's all about you
It's all about you Jesus


When the music fades
And all is stripped away
And I simply come
Longing just to bring
Something that's of worth
That will bless Your heart


i'll bring you more than a
For a song in itself
is not what you have
You searched much deeper
Through the way things
You're looking into my heart

You searched much deeper
Through the way things
You're looking into my heart


king of endless worth
no one could express
how much you deserve
Though I'm weak and poor
All i have is yours
Every single breathe
