I heard
(I heard)

You were
(you were)

Wondering
(wondering if God still answers prayer)

I heard
(I heard)

That you were
(that you were)

Searching for a sign
(searching for a sign)

That He was still right there

Every time you shake my hand oh yeah

Every time you see me dance oh yeah

You can tell by looking

But I ain't got time to tell ya

All you really need to know is

I'm a living, breathing, walking, talking, moving miracle

People said I'd never, they said I'd never ever but stop, look, watch

Cause I am,
I am...


So who are they...

Compared to he...

Greater is he...

Than what you see

Greater is he...

If he never ever does another thing

He's already done more than I could dream

We love you we give you the praise

He gave his life for me,

Just so I could live mine totally free

We love you, we give you the glory

All for me

Did it all for me

He left his throne came to earth unknown for me

Did it all for me, did it all for me

And he took that walk

Carrying that cross for me

Did it all for me

I'm here to lift Jesus high till the world is lightened by his shine

Lord, you'll be forever Glorified

And everywhere that I go

I'm gonna make sure everybody knows

That you are, you are God alone

All for me

Did it all for me

He left his throne
Came to earth unknown for me

Did it all for me, did it all for me

And he took that walk

Carrying that cross for me

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Did it all for me

Did it all for me

He left his throne came to earth unknown for me

Did it all for me, did it all for me

and he took that walk

Carrying that cross for me

Did it all for me

Did it all for me
