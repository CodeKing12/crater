I lift my hands

With all my heart

With all my heart

I love you Lord

With all my heart

With all my heart

I Worship you

With all my heart

With all my heart

Oh be lifted

Above all other gods

we lay our crowns

And worship you

Ejoba oluwa
(you reign, Lord you reign)

Laye ati Lorun
(In heaven and on earth)

Ejoba oluwa
(You reign, Lord you reign)
