SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

I
Freed, delivered.

I
Grace and favour

Right now is the moment
Today is the day
I

I have waited for this moment to come
And I won

I won
Can

To the way it used to be
For your presence came and changed me

Lord God almighty
You are clothed with majesty

The heavens declare your wonders
For you are great and do marvelous things

For you alone art God

There is no one else like you

Let the nations declare
That you have done great things

Mighty you are
Holy you are

Your mercy endureth for evermore

Righteous you are
Great you are

I will exalt you oh lord my God my king

For you alone art God

There is no one else like you

Let the nations declare
That you have done great things

Mighty you are
Holy you are

Your mercy endureth for evermore

Righteous you are
Great you are

I will exalt you oh lord my God

Oh oh
