JOY TO THE WORLD

Joy to the world! The lord has come
Let earth receive her king!
Let every heart prepare his room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven, and heaven and nature sing

Joy to the world the savior reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and and floods
Rocks, hills and plains
Repeat their sounding joy
Repeat their sounding joy
Repeat, repeat their sounding joy

No more let sins and sorrows grow
Nor thorn infest their ground
He comes to make
His blessings flow
Far as the curse is found
Far as the curse is found
Far as, far as the curse is found


O COME ALL YE FAITHFUL

O come all ye faithful
Joyful and triumphant
O come ye, o come ye to Bethlehem
Come and behold him
born the king of angels
O come, let us adore him
O come, let us adore him
O come, let us adore him
Christ the lord

O sing, choirs of angels
Sing in exultation
Sing all that hear in heaven God
Give to our fathers glory in the highest
O come, let us adore him
O come, let us adore him
O come, let us adore him
Christ the lord

All hail ! lord, we greet thee
Born this happy morning
O Jesus forever more be thy name adored
Word of the father now in flesh appearing
O come, let us adore him
O come, let us adore him
O come, let us adore him
Christ the lord
