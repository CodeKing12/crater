As The Deer
As the deer panteth for the
So my soul longeth after thee
You alone are my heart's
And I long to worship thee

You alone are my strength,
To you alone may my spirit
You alone are my heart's
And I long to worship thee

You're my friend and you are
Even though you are a king
I love you more than any
So much more than anything

You alone are my strength,
To you alone may my spirit
You alone are my heart's
And I long to worship thee

I want you more than gold or
only you can satisfy.
You alone are the real
and the apple of my eye.
