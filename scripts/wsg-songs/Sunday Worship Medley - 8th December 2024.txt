Wonderful, merciful Savior

Precious Redeemer and Friend

Who would have thought that a Lamb

Could rescue the souls of men

Oh, You rescue the souls of men

You are the One that we praise

You are the One we adore

You give the healing and grace

Our hearts always hunger for

Oh, our hearts always hunger for

At the center of it all

It's you that I see it's you that I see

There is power in your name

Miracles happen in your name

As we lift our voice in praise

It's you that I see it's you that I see

(You are Good to Me)

I cannot help but

Give you Praise

Idi
(You are Good to Me)

I cannot help but Worship YOU
