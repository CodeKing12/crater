I have no other God but you

You have done what no man has done

and you will do what no man can do

Immortal and visible, God only wise,

In light and accessible

you live in our hearts

Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,

Almighty, victorious, thy great name we praise.

The Great Physician now is near,

The sympathizing Jesus;

He speaks the drooping heart to cheer,

Oh, hear the voice of Jesus!

Sweetest note in seraph song,

Sweetest name on mortal tongue,

Sweetest carol ever sung:

Jesus! blessed Jesus!

Onisegun nla wa nihin,

Jesu abanidaro;

Oro Re mu ni l'ara da,

A gbo ohun ti Jesu.

Iro didun l'orin Seraf',

Oruko didun li ahon;

Orin to dun julo ni:

Jesu, Jesu, Jesu
