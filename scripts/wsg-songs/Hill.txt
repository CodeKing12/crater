MINISTERING
THE HILL

The

Sin around me

Pain is in me

Stress is on me

But I gotta keep looking up

Tears are streaming

Heart is beating

Others leaving

But I gotta keep looking up

Some will trust in horses and chariots

But I will look to the hills and I will not fear

Some may say that they found another way

But my eyes are on you and I will not move from...

The Hill... Hill... Hill

Trouble has found me

Pressure is crowding

People doubting

But I gotta keep looking up

Ground is shaking

Walls are breaking

And my heart is racing

But I gotta keep looking up

Some will trust in horses and chariots

But I will look to the hills and I will not fear

Some may say that they found another way

But my heart

The Hill...

Some may trust in horses and chariots

But I will look to the hills and I will not fear

Some may say that they found another way

But my eyes are on you and I will not move


On the hill there

On the cross there is blood for me for me

Thank you for your blood Jesus [x2]

Thank you for you the blood

For you washed away my sins

Nothing but the blood

Oh Precious

Oh precious is that blood on the hill

On the hill there

On the cross there is blood for me...for me

Still have the power

Wonderful power

To heal our diseases

To cover our weakness

Still have the power

Wonderful power


To heal our diseases

To cover our weakness

Still have the power

Wonderful power

To heal our diseases

To cover our weakness

On the hill there

for me [

The cross don

The cross don

The cross don

There
