MINISTERING
LIGHT OF THE WORLD

VERSE
light of the world

We stand on your word

All heaven and Earth

CHORUS
We praise you forever and ever sing

Just as we received his word

Mercy and grace are unfolding

And nothing can tear it down

Especially if God be for me

VERSE
We love you

We love you, we love you

There's nothing above you

I'm in you

There's nothing above me
