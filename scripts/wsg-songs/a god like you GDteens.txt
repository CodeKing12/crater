"A God Like You"

Everybody wanna be like you
They want power and praise like you

But see there is no god like our God
There's no one like you

Who gave their life like you?
And who paid our price like you?

See there's only one god that's our God
There's no one like you.

Who can touch like you
Or heal us like you do

We stumble and we stray
'til you always get us through

Who makes all things new
And comes to our rescue

Death, hell and the grave
They could not conquer you

You became just like me
To unlock and set free

This prisoner that was deeply wounded and redeemed
The me I could not see

Everybody wanna be like you
They want power and praise like you

But see there is no god like our God
There's no one like you

Who gave their life like you?
And who paid our price like you?

See there's only one god that's our God
There's no one like you.

Some may worship things
But what joy do they bring?

They try and hide the stains
But can they set us free?

See where would we be
Without Calvary

A king upon a tree?
So the whole world can see

You became just like me
To unlock and set free

This prisoner that was deeply wounded and redeemed
The me I could not see

Everybody wanna be like you
They want power and praise like you

But see there is no god like our God
There's no one like you

Who gave their life like you?
And who paid our price like you?

See there's only one god that's our God
There's no one like you.

[2x:]

Healer, father, savior
Counselor, friend, provider

You was, is and forever
That's why I just wanna be where you are

I'll travel life with you no matter how far

[4x:]
Hey, hey, hey

Became just like me
To unlock and set free

This prisoner that was deeply wounded and redeemed
The me I could not see

Everybody wanna be like you
They want power and praise like you

But see there is no god like our God
There's no one like you

Who gave their life like you?
And who paid our price like you?

See there's only one god that's our God
There's no one like you.

There's no one like you,
There's no one like you,

There's no god like our God
There's no one like you. [8x]
