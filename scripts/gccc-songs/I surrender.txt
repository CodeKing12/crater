I surrender all,
I surrender all.
All to Thee, my blessed
I surrender all.

All to Jesus I surrender,
Humbly at His feet I
Worldly pleasures all
Take me, Jesus, take me

All to Jesus I surrender,
Make me, Savior, wholly
Let me feel Thy Holy
Truly know that Thou art

All to Jesus I surrender,
Lord, I give myself to
Fill me with Thy love and
Let Thy blessing fall on

All to Jesus I surrender,
Now I feel the sacred
Oh, the joy of full
Glory, glory to His
name!
