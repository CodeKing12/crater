MINISTERING
MY WORDS HAVE POWER

My words have power to defeat the enemy

Those same words have power to speak life and prosperity

I have been given the authority,

I can move mountains by the words that I speak

By the power invested in me,

I decree,
God's favor is resting on me

I know my words,
My words have power

My destiny depends on me,

I've changed my vocabulary

From now I'm standing on what I believe

There is no limit to what I decree

I know my words, my words have power,

My word
(My word)

I speak it!

I speak over my life

I speak over your life
