PRAISE TEAM

Majesty

Forever I am changed by your love

In the presence of your majesty.

Your grace has found me just as I am

Empty handed but alive in your hands


PRAISE:

These are the days of Elijah

Declaring the work of the Lord

And these are the days of your servant Moses

Righteousness being restored

And though these are days of great trials of famine and darkness and sword

Still we are the voice in the desert crying

Prepare ye the way of the Lord

Behold he comes riding on the cloud

Shining like the sun at the trumpet call

Lift your voice it's the year of jubilee

Out of Zion

There
