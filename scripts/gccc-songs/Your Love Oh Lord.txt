Chorus 1
I will lift my voice
To worship You my King
I will find my strength
In the shadow of Your wings

Your love oh Lord
Reaches to the heavens
Your faithfulness
Stretches to the sky
Your righteousness
Is like the mighty mountains
Your justice flows
Like the ocean's tide

ENDING
Your love O Lord
Reaches to the heavens
Your faithfulness
Stretches to the sky
