Your goodness is all I see everyday

You're faithful and true to your word

You have always gat my back

Oni duro mi o (My Garantor)

That is why I say odara (It is good)

Who am I that you are mindful of

You pick me from the mary clay

and set my feet on the rock to stay

You've been so good so good

So good in all your ways

That is why I say odara

Odara si mi ( You are good to me)

Ni gbogbo igba (All the time)

Odara si mi o (You are good to me)

Lojo jumo (All the time)
