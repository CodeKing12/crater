Verse 1

His grace keeps working like a Tablet

All over my life, it strikes the Devil like a Mallet

Heaven is my place while the grace is my Dialect

I'm sharing with people me, not saving it like the Wallet

I say it's nothing below his Grace

He fed the Israelites with manna for Days

The blind man had his sight back just in a day

I may not be paid for this but it pays

I couldn't find my way but I found Grace

Everytime I look around me all I see is Grace

I couldn't find solution to my own Case

But when he gave me grace I got to know the Details

I had to give my life to Christ first

Led me through at all Cost

The devil brought challenges on our way but God has saved us

Thou hath blessed us, you didn't make my soul rust

You love us sent your son to save us

Verse 2

It's your Grace I'm getting from, Keep me all night long till Dawn

When I wake up every morning all I see nothing Wrong

God is always by my side, doing wonders all the time

I cannot comprehend the way you saved me many times

Many have asked me this Question, saying my God is awesome

They say you love me so much that your son paid the Random

I'm your son, your nursing me, to be a person

I'mma serve you every month God that is a Dozen

You deserve more than enough, God to me, I cannot pay

All the things you've done for me on this Earth in any way

At least, I've still gotta say that my God is gonna Reign

From now till tomorrow, everyday we gonna Win
