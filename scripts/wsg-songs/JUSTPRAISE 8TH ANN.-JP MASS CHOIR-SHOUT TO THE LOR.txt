MINISTERING
SHOUT TO THE LORD

chorus
Shout to the LORD
All the earth let us sing

Mountains bow down and the seas will roar

At the sound of your name

I sing for joy at the work of your hands

Forever I'll love you forever I'll stand

Nothing compares to the promise I have in you

Never cease to worship you
