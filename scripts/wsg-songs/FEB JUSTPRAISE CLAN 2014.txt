JUSTPRAISE CLAN
MINISTERING
FLOW TO YOU

chorus
Flow to You
flow to You

Let the river of my worship
Flow to You

Lord I Pray
In all I do

Let the river of my worship
Flow to you

Like Streams in the valley
(they)swell with the rain

let the songs of my heart
rise to bless Your Name
and flow to You.

Let all my worship
Let all my Praise

flow to You
flow to you

Let all my Worship
Let all my Praise

Flow to You

Nobody but You
