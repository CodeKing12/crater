MINISTERING
YOU ARE THE REASON I LIVE

VERSE
You are the reason I Live

You're the one for me

You're the one for me

You are the reason I Live

You're the one for me

You're the one for me

CHORUS
Why should I fear when I have You

Surrounded by your love

Your everlasting love

Why should I care what people say

Cause they don't know

What you mean to me

BRIDGE
You're the one for me...
