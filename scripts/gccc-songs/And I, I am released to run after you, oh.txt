And I, I am released to
And I, I am released to

And I am not afraid to run
To run with all my

And I am not ashamed to
To run with all my

It's a relentless pursuit, a
I will not stop chasing
It's a relentless pursuit, a
I will not stop chasing

It's a relentless pursuit,
I will not stop chasing
It's a relentless pursuit, a
I will not stop chasing

I can't take my eyes off of
I can't take my mind off of
I'm hopelessly crazy in
You've taken the keys and
And now I'm running, I'm
The love of my life
Oh you the love of my life
