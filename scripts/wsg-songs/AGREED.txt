AGREED


I heard an old story
About a savior that came from glory

How He gave His life at Calvary
He did it all just for me

They nailed Him in His hands
They nailed Him in His feet

They nailed Him to a cross to die
And all of the while, He was thinking of me

Cause in those nails, was every mistake I made
The thorns were formed from my lies

The lashes You took, they were meant for me
But You told God You would take them instead

You agreed to do it
You agreed to die

You agreed to give Your life to save mine
Oh what a sacrifice You made for me

Knowing all that You would have to go through
You agreed

I could never repay You
But I'm sure gonna praise You

We love You
We praise You

You're worthy
Hallelujah

Knowing all that You would have to go through
You agreed
