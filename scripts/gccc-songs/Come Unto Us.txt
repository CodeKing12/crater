Slide 1
This is our song
One humble plea
Lord here we are
In need of Thee
And so we wait
With expectations
As we proclaim
The God of Jacob

Slide 2
Come come unto us
Come unto us
Breath of heaven
Breathe breathe into us
Life out of dust
Spirit of Jesus

Slide 3
Weary we fall
Before Your throne
Just travelers
Longing for home
With confidence
Sealed by Your blood
Lord we approach You
The King of love

Slide 4
God is with us
Hallelujah
Emmanuel
Christ is risen
Hallelujah
Emmanuel
