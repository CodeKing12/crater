Unreserved, unrestrained
Your love is wild, Your love is
It isn
Your love is proud to be

cause You don
You don

Uncontrolled, un-contained
Your love is a fire burning
It
Your love is a light, and all

You don
You don
You don
You don

Your love
It
It isn

Your love
It
It
It hangs on every word we
Love keeps its promises, it

It honors what
Your love
