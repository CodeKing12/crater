MINISTERING
I AM ONE WITH YOU

You did not create me to worry

You did not create me to fear

But You created me to worship daily

So Imma leave it all right here

My hands are raised because I surrender

Your will is what's best for me

I worship You because You're Jehovah Jireh

I bow before the King of kings

No more crying no more complaining

I know that Your word is true

Lord You promised never to leave me lonely

So this is what I've always known

I am one with You Lord

I am always one with You

You did not create me to worry

You did not create me to fear

But You created me to worship daily

So Imma leave it all right here

My hands are raised because I surrender

Your will is what's best for me

I worship You because You're Jehovah Jireh

I bow before the King of kings

No more crying no more complaining

I know that Your word is true

Lord You promised never to leave me lonely

So this is what I've always known

I am one with You Lord

I am always one with You

I am always... one... with...

You did not create me to worry

You did not create me to fear

But You created me to worship daily

So Imma leave it all right here
