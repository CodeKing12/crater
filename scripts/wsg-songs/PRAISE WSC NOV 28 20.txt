I've come before you today

There's only one thing that I want to say

Thank you Lord

For all you've done in my life

For all the blessings that I have received

Thank you Lord

With a grateful heart

With a song of praise

With an outstretched arm
I will bless your name

Thank you Lord

Water you turn into wine

Open the eyes of the blind

There's no God like you

None like you

Into the darkness we shine

Out of the glory we rise

There's no God like you

None like you

Our God is greater

Our God is stronger

Lord you are higher than any other

Our God is healer

Awesome in power

Every praise is to our God

Every Word of worship with one accord

Every praise every praise is to our God

Sing hallelujah to our God

Glory hallelujah is due our God

Every praise every praise is to our God

Come and see what the Lord has done for me

He has taken away my sorrows and now I'm free
