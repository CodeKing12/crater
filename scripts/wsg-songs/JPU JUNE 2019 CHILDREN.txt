WORD SANCTUARY
CHILDREN FELLOWSHIP

God of love

God of life

The only reason why I'm still here

God of love and of grace

You touched my life I'm forever changed

Life was so empty until you came in

When I was weak you showed me your strength

Now I'm convinced that I can do anything with you

With you I find my strength

With you I can hold on

With you I know I'm covered

No greater power than you

Nobody's greater then you

Holy spirit holy spirit holy spirit I love you

You guide me in all things

You guide me in all things

Holy spirit holy spirit

You have opened my eyes

You have opened my eyes

Holy spirit holy spirit

Now I realize with you I need nobody

Cause you talk to me and you guided me

And to my surprise you are real

Than the air  I breathe

Holy ghost holy ghost
