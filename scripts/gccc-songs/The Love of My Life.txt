Verse 1
Whenever You call my name,
I cannot resist You.
You are irrestiable.
Whatever You have to say,
Iwon't contradict You.
That would be unthinkable.
I was lost, now I'm found.
You have turned my life around.
Sun comes up, sun goes down.
Knowing You is all that matters.

Chorus
You are the love of my life.
You are my One and ONly.
You are the love of my life.
This is my testimony.
I'm Yours and Yours forever
'cause You have captured my heart.
Jesus You are the love of my life.

Slide
The love of my life.
And I've never known a love like this before.
You're everything I'll ever need and more.
The love of my life.
And I'm always goona follow where You go,
'cause I belong to You and You alone.
