This is communion, Your body broken
The cup we're drinking is bittersweet
The gift of friendship, truest salvation
Borne of Your suffering on Calvary

We remember the sacrifice of love
We remember the blood poured out for us
We remember the only Son of God upon the cross

From stained to spotless, from wrath to favor
Through You our Savior, the work completeIn full repentance, led by Your kindness
Partake of presence as we receive

We remember the sacrifice of love
We remember the blood poured out for usWe remember the only Son of God upon the cross
We remember the price You had to pay
We remember the wounds that made a way
We remember the Lamb, for all was slain upon the cross

How can it be?There is a table
For all who would come
For all who would come

Taste now and see
There is a table
For all who would come
For all who would come

Take of the bread, receive the cup
(There is a table) For His mercy is enough
(For all who would come) For the many and the one
(For all who would come) This is communion
(Taste now and see) Take it as often as you will
(There is a table) For His blood has power still
(For all who would come) By His wounds we shall be healed
(For all who would come) This is communion

Take of the bread, receive the cup
For His mercy is enough
For the many and the one
This is communionTake it as often as you will
For His blood has power still
By His wounds we shall be healed
This is communion
