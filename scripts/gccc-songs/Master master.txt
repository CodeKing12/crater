You reign on high
Yahweh reign on high
You reign on high
You reign

You write my story
Yahweh write my story
You write my story
You reign

You reign in my life
Yahweh reign in my life
You reign in my life
You reign

I am yours you
Where you lead  I will follow
Rabboni Rabboni

In the night in the day
Everywhere, Everytime
I will follow
Rabboni

Master master
I wanna be just right behind you
Master master
I wanna be just right behind you
