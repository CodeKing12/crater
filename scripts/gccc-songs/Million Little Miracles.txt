All my life, I've been carried
Don't ask me how 'cause I
It's nothing short of a

I've got some blessings that
I've got some scars, but
It's nothing short of a

I think it over and it doesn't
I know it comes from above

I've got miracles on miracles
A million little miracles
Miracles on miracles
Count your miracles
One, two, three, four, I can't

You held me steady so I
You opened doors that
I hope I never get over what

I wanna live with an open
I wanna live like I know who
I hope I never get over what

It's not coincidence and it's
I know it comes from above

Miracles on miracles
A million little miracles
Miracles on miracles
Count your miracles
One, two, three, four, I can't

I can't even, I can't even
One, two, three, four, I can't
even count 'em all
