I just want to be where you are
Dwelling daily in your presence
I don't want to worship from afar
Draw me near to where you are

I just want to be where you are
In your dwelling place forever
Take me to the place where you are
'Cause I just want to be with you
I just want to be with you

I just want to be with you
