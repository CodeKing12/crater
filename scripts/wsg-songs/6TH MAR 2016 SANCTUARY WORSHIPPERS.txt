SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

Let praises rise
from the inside

From the inside of me

May you delight in the inside

In the inside of me

Come fill my life from the inside

From the inside of me

Set me on fire
from the inside

From the inside of me


Cos all I want is for you

you to be glorified

You to be lifted high

All I want is for you

You to be glorified

You to be lifted high


Be glorified,
be glorified,
be glorified,
be glorified.


I wanna live a life that

I wanna serve you Lord for real

For you deserve all these and more

So I give you more.


Oh the worshipper in me wants to be free

From the cares of life that seems to weigh me

Oh the worshipper in me needs consistency

To lift my hands and give you praise when no

Oh the worshipper in me wants to break free

From this intellectual mentality

Like when I should be up am seated in my seat

I should be lifting my hands

Giving you praise and glory


I wanna give my best to you

I wanna do what you ask me to

I wanna go wherever you say

Just say the word and I will obey

I wanna live a life that

I wanna serve you Lord for real

For you deserve all these and more

So I give you more


More, more

I give you more

More, more


You

You

You

You


I give you more

I give you more

I give you more

I give you more


I surrender all

I surrender all

All to thee my blessed Saviour

I surrender all
