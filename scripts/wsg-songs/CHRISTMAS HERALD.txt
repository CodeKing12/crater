Merry merry merry merry merry Christmas

Hark hark the bells sweet silver bells

All seem to say throw cares away

Christmas is here

Bringing good cheers to young and old

Meek and the bold

Ding dong ding dong that is the song

With joyful ring all caroling

One seems to hear words of good cheer

From everywhere, filling the air
Oh how they pound raising their sound

O

Gaily they ring and why people sing

Songs of good cheer christmas is here

Gaily they ring and why people sing

Songs of good cheer christmas is here

Merry merry merry merry merry Christmas
