There is a KINGDOM;
A Kingdom of Spirits,
An Eternal life-filled home of Divinity,
A Home of Perfect Immortals;
Owned and ruled by the EVER MIGHTY KING!!
Whose words brought every creation
Into a visible and physical existence;

Its Name is HEAVEN,
YES Heaven, THE NATION OF GOD!!!

Heaven is God's Nation.
A Spiritual abode of True Joy,
A Special residence of True Peace.

Heaven is Beautiful.
Its Grandeur is Matchless,
Its Glory is Wonderful,
Every other Creation cannot surpass.

Name it!!!
The Seven Continents in all their uniqueness?
The Firmament and wonders of Nature?
The Beauties Beneath the Earth and Seas?
Even Africa's Pride with all her natural Endowment--

None of these and more-
Can be compared to the glimpse
Of God's Glorious Home.
Though they all are the Art Work of the Aged Artistic Creator,
They won't still match-up to the Marvellously Bestowed Nature of Heavens

Talk of men's Intelligence and Creative Skills,
They are no match too.
They are all a Frail Show-off of Beauty,
A Nonstop Research and Worked out Experiments;
For the purpose of Self Ease and JOY;
Which is still not found...

But Heaven!!
Oh! Glorious Heaven...
The Only  Nation with pure Joy.
Unsearchable with Brain,
Inaccessible by Toil.

You don't have to Dig too Deep to find it,
Neither will you have to Search too Far to get it;
Lo!!! It is Within YOU!

You just have to know the one--
Who was Sent and Slain
For to Save men's souls from the--
Powers of Darkness and Hell
In other to translate us into the Kingdom Light.

Believe and Receive him--
for the Purpose of which he was sent..
And PAH!!!
In NO-SECOND,
You're one of us in GODS' NATION.

For he has Called us out to be  Partakers of the Heavenly Calling.
A Royal Priesthood,
A Peculiar People,
And YES! A HOLY NATION!
HEAVEN!!!!

Nations of the world are perused by Gods Critics;
Being void of Understanding,
Their unbelieve clouds them from comprehending
What God has planned from the beginning till the end..
For it is unreasonable to them;
How The Key to the Home of True Eternal Joy appears so simple,
Compare to their Search and Re-search for Ease and Joy..

But NO!
No one can talk down on Heavens' Splendid Mysteries;
For God indeed has chosen the foolish things of this world
To confound the wise.
A Sacrificial Lamb sorts it all out!!!

And as for us the ambassadors of God's Nation,
We have this strong  confidence..
That we have become his Nation ourselves..
For he's lives in us and we in him..
Being Joint Heirs to his grace through Jesus Christ our Lord...

HEAVEN, Yes Heaven is GOD'S NATION.
All Citizens and Angels worship in Adoration
To the Majestic one who sits on the Radiant Throne--
Which leaves one in Awe...

HEAVEN is GOD'S NATION
And only the Faithful, Just, Pure,True and Holy-
are Called into her Convocation..
