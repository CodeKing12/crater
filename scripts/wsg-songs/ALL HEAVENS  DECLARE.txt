ALL HEAVENS  DECLARE

All heaven declare the glory
of the risen Lord

Who can compare to the beauty of the risen

Forever you will be the lamb
upon the throne

I gladly sing my praise to worship
you alone

I will proclaim the gospel of the
Risen Lord

Who once was slain to reconcile
God and man

Forever you will be the lamb
upon the throne

I gladly bow my knee and worship
you alone
