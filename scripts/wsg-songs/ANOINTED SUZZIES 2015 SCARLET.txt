SCARLET

Middle of nowhere
Finally you can breathe
Nobody knows your name
Its easier

Shut your eyes tightly
Clench your fist till they almost bleed
Cautiously, tightly
Gently expose what's underneath

All you can feel now
Is scarlet in the day
Even its real
You can't stay

Chorus
So there you go
You're gone for good
There you go
You're gone for good

Verse 2
Your mind is swollen
From months of thoughts without release
They've taken their toil on you
And this very moment
Of timid and fragile honesty
Is precious and rare and fleeting

And all you feel now
Is the scarlet in the day
And even if its real
You can't stay


Chorus
So there you go
You're gone for good
There you go
You're gone for good
