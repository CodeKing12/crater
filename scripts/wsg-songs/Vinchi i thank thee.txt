I thank thee oh Father
Lord of the heaven, heaven and earth

The Lord, the Lord God
Merciful and gracious in all your ways

Long suffering and abundant in goodness
And in truth...goodness and truth

Keeping mercy for thousands
Forgiving iniquities and trangressions and sins

you are good and your mercy  endureth forever and ever...

Blessed be the name of Lord God of all nations

Blessed be the name of LORD God of our Father

blessed be the name of the LORD God of all Israel

Blessed be the name of LORD God of our Father
