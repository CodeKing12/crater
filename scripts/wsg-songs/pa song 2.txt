I praise you

I praise you, oh God

In my life

I see what you're doing, Everytime

I lift my hands in praise of your name

Iwo ni mo ni laye lorun
(All I have is you heaven and earth)

Iwo ni mo ni
(All I have is you)

Jesu iwo ni mo ni
(Jesus all I have is you)

Iwo ni mo fe laye lorun
(All I want is you heaven and earth)

Iwo ni mo fe
(All I want is you)

Jesu iwo ni mo fe
(Jesus all I want is you)

It is a great thing to serve the Lord

Walking in the light of God

Oh walk, walk, walk, walking in the light of God

Yahweh

Your name is Yahweh...

You are the miracle working God,
Your name is Yahweh

If the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead, dwells in me

He shall quicken my mortal body since the spirit dwells in me

I am glad, I belong to Jesus, I belong to Jesus, I belong to my Lord

Mo layo, pe mo je ti Jesu, pe mo je ti Jesu, pe mo je t

You gave Your life for me

I give my life to you Jesus

You gave Your all for me

I give my all to you Jesus
