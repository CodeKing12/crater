GOOD NEWS TO ALL THE WORLD

Good news to all the world

Good news to all who hear

Good news to everyone

Let

Believe that Jesus died

And that he rose again

He wants to live in you

And be your savior and your friend

He

And learn from things above

Let
And do it all in love

He

And ways that we can serve

We want to know his perfect plan by following his word

Good news to the entire world

Good news to all who hear

Good news to everyone

Believe that Jesus died

And that he rose again

He wants to live in you
And be your savior and your friend

We pledge to do this work
With the whole of our spirit

We are taking God
We are soldiers for Christ
