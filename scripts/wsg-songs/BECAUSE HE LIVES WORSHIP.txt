WORSHIP MEDLY

BECAUSE HE LIVES WORSHIP

Because he lives I can face tomorrow

Because he lives all fear is gone

Because I know he owns my future

My life is worth a living just because he lives

For death could not hold him captive

Even in the grave

Jesus is Lord

Even in the grace

Jesus is Lord

My soul just magnify the Lord

And My spirit praise His name

For death could not hold Jesus captive

Even in the grave

Jesus is Lord

Even in the grave

Jesus is Lord

Hallelujah you have won the victory

Hallelujah you have won it all for me

Death could not hold you down

You are the risen king.

Seated in majesty

You are the risen king

Death could not hold you down

You are the risen king

Seated in majesty Lord

You are the risen king

You are the risen king 2x

And only you Jesus can satisfy

Only you can fill the void in our hearts

Only you Jesus

If you

If you

Search no more search no more oh my brother

For in Jesus you have it all

Only Jesus can satisfy

Only Jesus can satisfy

I

Oh in Jesus You have it all

Only Jesus can satisfy

Nothing in this world can satisfy my soul

I

and I

In Jesus you have it all.

Everything you need is in Jesus

In Jesus you have it all
