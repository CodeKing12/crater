I
A story between you and I
What can separate me now?
Absolutely nothing
Definitely nothing

No lack, no shame, no fear, no lies o
Not loss, not pain, not guilt, not death o
Resp: absolutely nothing
Definitely nothing

No boy, no girl, no friend, no foe o
No wealth, no car, no fame, no place o
Resp: absolutely nothing
Definitely nothing

Call: your people
Resp: my people
Call: your heart cry
Resp: my burden
Call: your vision
Resp: my vision
Call: your word
Resp: is my promise
Call: your will
Resp: is my meal o
