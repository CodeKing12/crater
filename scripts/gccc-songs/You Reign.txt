Chorus 1
Long before You ever said let there be light
Long after this world has had it's final night
Great God in heaven
You'll be where You've always been
Seated on Your holy throne

King of kings looking down on men
You are ruler above all the nations
Sovereign through all generations
Lord You reign

One day all kings will tremble before You
I will bow down and adore You
Lord You reign

Morning and night the sky shouts Your majesty
Saying the whole universe is under Your feet
This is the peace in my heart
The strength of my soul
Whatever happens in life
This much I know
You are in control

There is none like You
Lord You are worthy
Ev'rything You do always is perfect
There is none like You Lord
You are worthy
Ev'rything You do always is perfect
