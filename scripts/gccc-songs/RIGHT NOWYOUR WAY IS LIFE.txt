I wanna sit at your feet
Just to hear your voice again
Lord I need you to come

Right now all I want to do
Is to sit at your feet Watching you, teaching me your ways
Listening to the treasures of your heart.

Your way is light
Your way is light
Your way is light
Your way is light

Away from the noise
Away from the world
Just your voice
I want your light
away from addiction away from depression i need your light
Just your voice
Just your word
Just your light
Just your word
I want your voice
Give me your light
All i need is your light shine your light i want your light
