I will bless the Lord

I will sing a song

Through all the earth

Oh oh oh worship him

And adore him

Oh oh oh worship him

And adore him

I will bless his name

For My God is good

I will bless his name

For My God is good

For his glory fills the temple

Beyond the farthest star

For his glory fills the temple

Beyond the farthest star

I will bless his holy name

I will bless his holy name

I will bless his holy name

For My God is good
