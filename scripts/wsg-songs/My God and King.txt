Verse 1
My God and King

To you alone I sing

You

For all eternity

Chorus
You

Just to be with you

How I

With eyes for only you

Verse 2
My God and King

Through the storm I sing

Covered by your wings

This song of love I bring

CHORUS
you are my dream come true

I am one with you

How I

With eyes for only you
