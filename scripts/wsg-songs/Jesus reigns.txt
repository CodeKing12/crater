Sons and daughters gather now

All behold the lamb of God

Born to take our sins away

Conquered death hell and the grave

Let the whole world see

There's no greater name

Let the whole world shout it out

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Jesus reigns

Jesus reigns

Oh oh oh oh

Jesus reigns

You're Lord forever

Innocent yet crucufied

With my freedom on your mind

Yes the stone is rolled away

With all power you've been raised

(let the whole world see)

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Jesus reigns Jesus reigns

Oh oh oh oh

Jesus reigns

You are Lord forever

The winds and the seas obey you reign

And We'll make one shout

Till we shake the foundation

Bringing God from heaven down

Let the whole see

There's no greater name

Let the whole world shout it out
