I have come to realise

That there are certain terms used

by many Christians today

Words that slow us down

Words that hold us bound

Few I have come to address today.

Past!

A common term used by many

Guilt!

Another popular disease.

Sin!

The father of all

Well..

I have not come here today to cast faults or blame

But I have come to declare the Word of God.

For many hold up their past and have refused

to enter into the future God has prepared for them.

Many keep the guilt of their wrongs so

dearly in their hearts,

they have refused to see what Christ has done.

Many are still bound to the shackles of sin,

they have refused to live the life so freely given by Christ.

Past.... Guilt.... Sin

Are very unnecessary baggage

you don

So..

Drop it!

‘

Because we are surrounded by a great crowd

of witnesses to the life of faith,

Hence we must strip off every

weight that slows us down,

Especially the sin that so easily trips us up.

And we must run with patience

the race God has set before us.

‘


The good news is that you don't need to forget

For the mind holds so much information

you can't even begin to imagine

But all you need do is to always


remember that God has forgotten it.


PAUSE


I lived in a world were everything was enough,


I was wallowing in the abundance of


what  I thought was the best for me.


Everything was at my disposal,YES


There in that world, the thought,


how not to get reasonable and make sense to the real world


To us there, when it is actually unjust,


we take it to be right and just.


Nothing we thought was right was really right,


but it was right because we turned every wrong to be right.


Only the unreasonable can live in my world


because they are the species that make


sense to our kind of lifestyle.

Death,Pain and Stress was the package

that came along with my coronation

when I was initiated in the dark world,

Sorrow came beating me through the lust of the world,

but because of the sweetness of the pain that I enjoyed in tears.

My mind and sight was blinded to the sorrow,

I only saw sin to be my kinsman,

all I could was an enjoyable

moment with a foe in brotherhood.

Brothers powdered the makeups of dark arts,

Dark arts that were so close to the light,

but yet, light was so far because of

my unconsciousness to the cross.

Then I heard of a man who left crowns,

Throne,luxuries,company of angels,

the elders and the golds that

the foundation of heaven was laid with.

He laid in a lonely grave beaten,

bruised and brought low.

PAUSE

Yes!

Always remember that He has forgiven

you and has forgotten about it.

And so whatever it is has no hold over you again.

So stop playing P.A for God

By trying to always remind Him.

For he has forgotten!

Therefore if any man be in Christ,

He is a new creature

Old things are passed away

And all things are become new.

New!

That's who you are now!

New!

That who you have become.

So pick up your pen

And let's write this story all over again

Cause it's a new page

A new you!

PAUSE

This story made sense to my ear

that it brought me to my knees.

Tears flowing everywhere as much

as the sins I committed with my hands.

Then I looked at my both hands trembling,

chains and shackles falling off cautiously.

Then I came to my real sense

that became the testimony of my turning.

I turned swiftly to the direction

my Maker wanted me to face,

I became sober then I thought about the wasted years.

Oh what a great waste!

The thought of the man that died

swallowed my pride as I began

learning and meditating .

The man of Galilee,

the Savior of the world,

those Names melted every pain felt.

my pride then switched to Joy,

that Joy was of the host,

from the man of Galilee

Nevertheless the one that roams looking for whom to

destroy came to sow a seed of Sadness to

the sweet Joy that the man of Galilee gave me..

The sweet joy that comes from within my soul

Strongly within me, I knew what I wanted,

so I ran as far as my legs could carry me

Because this new life I have,

nothing can take Him from me

I have found Christ

I have found salvation


Eternity is sure because I am new


Hallelujah
