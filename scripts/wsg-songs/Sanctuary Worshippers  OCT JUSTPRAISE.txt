If I was an Eagle
I would lift myself
Spread my wings and fly

If I was a Lion
I would run into the jungle
And give the loudest growl

And if I was the sun
Yes I would rise early in the morning
And shine my light so bright

If I was an angel
I would sound the alarm
For the whole of creation
To bow at your feet
