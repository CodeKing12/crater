I will let the world know
You are mighty on your throne
Elohim
El Elohim Israel

Elohim Israel 2x
Yeshua hamashiach
Sabaoth

I hear a shout of Victory
In zion let the earth rejoice

To the mountain of fire we've come
To behold the lion and the lamb on the throne

On the wings the wind
On the chariots of seraphim
We join the angel to sing

let my soul rejoice

let the earth rejoice

I will say to my soul
You have overcome the world
and have found rest in GOD
