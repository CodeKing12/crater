How can I say thanks for the things you have done for me

Things so undeserved, yet you gave to prove your love for me

The voices of a million angels could not express my gratitude

All that I am and ever hope to be, yeah
I owe it all right now to thee

To God be the glory
To God be the glory
To God be the glory

For the things he has done

Just let me live my life and let it be pleasing, lord, to thee

And should I gain, should I gain any praise, let it go to calvary
Calvary

The very same God that spins things in orbit
He runs to the weary, the worn, and the weak

And the same gentle hands that hold me when I'm broken
They conquer death to bring me victory

Now I know my redeemer lives
See I know my redeemer lives

So let all creation testify, let this life within me cry
I know my redeemer

To God be the glory
To God be the glory
To God be the glory

For the things he has done
With his blood he has saved me
With his power lord has raised me

To God
To God be the glory

For the things
For the things

I wanna thank him for his grace his love his faithfulness to me

Thank him for the things that he has done
