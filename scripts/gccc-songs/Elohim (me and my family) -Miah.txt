There would never be a
There would never be a
There would never be a

There would never be a
There would never be a
There would never be a
That keeps me away from

Elohim...
You have loved me with no
Elohim...
You have touched me and
Elohim..
You have changed me,
Elohim...
You have touched me now

Thank you for coming
Thank you dying Elohim 2x

There will never be a Plan
There will never be a Path
There will never be a Way
That can be better than

There will never be a
There will never be a
There will never be a time
