SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

You are God and you are greater than anything

And I worship you

you are bigger than life to me

You are God and you are greater than anything

And I worship you

You are bigger than life to me

You are my breakthrough

Breakthrough

You are the God of my Breakthrough

You are my breakthrough

Breakthrough

You are the God of my Breakthrough

I'm walking in authority

Living life without apology

It's not wrong, dear, I belong here

So you might as well get used to me

My mother may not be a queen

But my Father's King of everything

I'm adopted into the family

So I guess that makes me royalty

And He's given me dominion yes(Oh Oh )

Power over men, them yes (oh)

Everything I do is blessed (oh)

Promised me some great success (oh)

I am the authority (oh)

God of the majority (oh)

Livin' in my liberty (oh)

So you might as well get used to me

I'm walking in authority, living life without apology

It's not wrong, dear, I belong here

So you might as well get used to me

We're children of the most-high God

Understand and believe His word

We never have to beg or plead

For our Father will supply our needs

I'm walking in authority, living life without apology

It's not wrong, dear, I belong here

So you might as well get used to me

I'm walking in prosperity, living life the way it's meant to be

It's not wrong, dear, I belong here

So you might as well get used to me

Get something in your hand

And wave it in the air

1 2 3 (oh)

1 2 3 (oh)

1 2 3 (oh)

So you might as well get used to me
