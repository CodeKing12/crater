I will put you in front

In front of my melody

You're all that matters

You're all that matters

I'll make room for two

You and I Jesus

You're all that matters

You're all that matters

Chorus
Owei, Owei

You're all that matters

Owei, Owei

You're all that matters

Owei, Owei

You're all that matters to me Jesus

Owei, Owei

You are all that matter

What would I live for

If I no get you for my life

What would I gain

If you take the Holy Ghost

What would have become of me

If to say you no hold my hands

What would have been said of me

If to say I no see your light

Now I've come to realise

That you are all I have

You're all that matters to me

You're all that matters to me

CHORUS:
Owei, Owei

You're all that matters

Owei, Owei

You're all that matters

Is it the house or is it the car

I'll give them all to you

Is it the name or the fame

I'm nothing without you

I will put you in front

In front of my melody

You're all that matters

You're all that matters

Owei, Owei
You're all that matters Jesus

Owei, Owei
You're all that matters
