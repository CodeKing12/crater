Couple years back

was lost in confusion

had to back track

no cap

war without a body jack

questions running through my mind

need a new tack

lost in world filled with faking and feigning...

so much I don't  know where to turn to

searching for sunlight right after the storm

but black clouds they don't  seem to wanna dissolve

yo I was done

this ain't  no fun

rising and falling had become the norm

trying to move on but stuck in my boots

demons was trying to loosen my screws

I was in deep

wondering "Jesus ain't gon want a sinner like me"

gotta escape this, cant stay any longer,

my mind finna pull-up, my heart can't get smaller

twas right in this moment

heard a voice call me like He called unto samuel

offering lovin' and teaching and sonship  in life class,

how could I say I ain't worth that

decided to earn it

opened my heart and let Jesus into me

best choice I ever made since I left Pre-school

gotta be right where my saviour wants me now

I'm climbing and growing and leaping

and soaring and sowing... my life

ain't  got meaning without Jesus in it

a shocker how I lived life before I met Him

twas struggle and hustle before I got access

to be with the Father and sit in His throne room

The blessing's now mine,

the Kingdom's the Father's ...yh



Verse

I'm forever changed

no longer am I the same

I've been forgiven

nothing is the same.

once I was a sinner

a very big offender

you stood in my stead now I'm called

the blessed.

by his blood I've been made free.


CHorus

I'm forever changed

no longer am I the same

I've been forgiven

nothing is the same.

the finished work is for me

he did it all for me

now I can walk with my head up high

forever I am changed

he's done it all for me

stepped into my life and gave me joy
