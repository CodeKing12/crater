ONE GOD ONE PEOPLE ONE VOICE

VERSE 1

When we were in darkness
When our joy was gone
When in fear and weakness
We could not go on
Then God sent the good news
He had paid the price
We could be accepted
Through the blood of Jesus Christ

CHORUS

So that with one heart
And with one voice
We may glorify the Father
For through Jesus Christ his Son
Every wall is broken down
And then one day, in his presence
We will fill all earth with harmony
United for eternity
One God one people one voice

VERSE 2

God gives us endurance
With his mighty hand
So we can reach the lost one
Help the weak to stand
Encouraging and Patient
Growing day by day
Following his footsteps
As he guides our homeward way....


CHORUS

So that with one heart
And with one voice
We may glorify the Father
For through Jesus Christ his Son
Every wall is broken down


And then one day, in his presence
We will fill all earth with harmony
United for eternity
One God one people one voice
One God one people one voice
One voice.
