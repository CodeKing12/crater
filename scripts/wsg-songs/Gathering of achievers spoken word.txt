I looked and behold I saw a pew

A company of men renown

those with class and prestige

But they seem just as row of heads

Yes! Figure heads in places I'd dare not mention

With no ounce of substance

So many years of their cleave, but nothing achieved

And yeah! We'd never be wrong calling 'em

"the gang of mischief"

But answer the call of the chief of the universe

HE who said gather in my name

but in most gatherings is found no name of His

HE said not to kill

but they rain hail on enemies day and night

Some traded His power for entertainment

His Word for tattletales

Having the substance of their faith eaten

And severely beaten by the world's systems

'cause of teachings that make 'em crawlers

They're men of esteem meant to produce

But their seeds are milked dry

They're Christians who can't reproduce another

Such a long list to ponder

Now a mixture of gold and clay

They're everything... But achievers

They make God look crazy

But God ain't in those things

HE is the God of the rich and the poor

'cause whatever you chose, He's remained Him

So show some respect to Elohim

Who's found a people and brought them his plan

They who acknowledge his sovereignty

and revere efforts of divinity

They're a breed who share love and humility

A city where everyone's a family

It's a kind of city HE has promised us

with streets of gold

And men with hearts of gold

Take a look at what HE has given;

a fat paycheck

A place where everyone's on God's payroll

A people with God's statutes, rules and laws

Taught in his ways and given a cause

The men and women shown their life's course

Not the kind scribbled on papers and pages of notes

For the Sophia we speak

transcends the world's encyclopedia

It's of course,

a company where there exists no curse

This is special

For the gathering of achievers

is the gathering of priests

You can hear them speak tongues

not like french or mandarin

They bear fruit in all truth and no lies

With the Spirit of HE

who's the truth and life

What more could I say

What I bring you is what HE expects of a church

A true gathering of Achievers

And you are
