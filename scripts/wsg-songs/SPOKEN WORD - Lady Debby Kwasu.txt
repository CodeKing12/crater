The goodness of God is indescribable

Starting by how he made mankind in his image and likeness

Making him name all his creations and

gave him power to have dominion over them

He made a companion for man and called

her a woman and put them in that beautiful garden

Despite, all the these good things, man still fell

But God decided to give man a second chance by

sending his only begotten son to die for mankind

and to restore us back to himself.. through his son,

we had hope of eternal life

However, man often forgets

Man tends to forget all these beautiful things

Oh! Men forgets

Just like how the Israelites forgot the God

the rained manna for them in the wilderness

They forgot the God that parted the red sea for them

The God that brought seen things out of the unseen

Are you not like the Israelites today?

Are you quick to complaining when things are not going well?

Moreover, David was different... he chose to be different

Because David always knew how to proclaim the goodness of God

In one of his Psalms, he said "praise the

lord", "oh my sou"l and forgets not all his benefits

Let's never forget his goodness in our lives always

We are comfortable, we give thanks

We are not comfortable, we give thanks

In all things, we give thanks
