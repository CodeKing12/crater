MINISTERING
ALL ABOUT YOU

Verse1

I see the sun rise over the horizon
and I'm grateful (for another day)

Because of your love I can face any
challenge that comes my way

Only in you I live, I move and I have my being (totally)

I surrender my will to yours

Make me who I am in you oh oh

Pre-chorus

In christ I can do all things

Really doesn't matter if the enemy

tries to harm me no weapon formed

will be able to prosper I will let

my light so shine so everyone

can see not me but He who

started a good work in me

shall complete it yeah yeah Oh

Chorus
I will pursue what pleases you

I will follow through coz I realize

It's all about you, you, you, you

I will pursue what pleases you

do what you tell me to

Coz I realise it's all about you you you

Verse2
Oh I tried to find my own way
through this maze

thought I could make it to my place
of destiny (But then I acknowledged you)

Stood naked in humility

Now I clearly see without you there's no me

Pre-chorus
In christ I can do all things

Really doesn't matter if the enemy

tries to harm me no weapon formed

will be able to prosper

I will let my light so shine

so everyone can see not me but He who

started a good work in me

He shall complete it yeah yeah
Ohh

Chorus

I will pursue what pleases you

I will follow through coz i realize

It's all about you, you, you, you

I will pursue what pleases you

do what you tell me to

Coz I realise it's all about you you you

It's all about you...

About you About you...
