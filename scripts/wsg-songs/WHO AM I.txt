WORD SANCTUARY MASS CHOIR INT
MINISTERING
WHO AM I

looked around and suddenly realized

That you've been so good to me

Your Mercy is Everlasting,
Undenying, Overwhelming.

Who am I that you are mindful of

Who am I that you hear my call
When I call you

Who am I that you are mindful of

Who am I that you hear my cries

The source of my strength
Na you

The strength of my life
Na you

My hope and my joy
Na you

My confidence
Na you

We exalt you
Oh God

Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh .....
