You are the same, yesterday today forever
Nobody is like You
You never change, yesterday today forever
Nobody loves me like You
You are the same, yesterday today forever
Nobody is like You
You never change, yesterday today forever
Nobody loves me like You
I worship You, I worship You, I worship You
You are the living God
