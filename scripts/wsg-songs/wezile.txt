MINISTERING
WEZILE

Wenzile okuhle kodwa
(He has done great things)

Empilweni yami yonke
(All the days of life)

Malibongwe! Malibongwe!
(Praise! Praise!)

Oh Malibongwe igama lenkosi
(Oh, praise the Name of the Lord)

verse
Wezwa ukukhala kwami
(He heard my cry)

Wangikhipha obishini olunzima
(He took me out of muddy pit)

Wangibeka edwaleni
(He placed me on a Rock)

Wangishiya neculo elisha
(And left me with a new song)
