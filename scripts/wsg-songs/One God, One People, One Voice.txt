When we were in darkness, when our joy was gone

When in fear and weakness we could not go on

Then God sent the good news: He had paid the price

We could be accepted through the blood of jesus christ

So that with one heart and with one voice, We may glorify the Father

For through Jesus Christ his son, ev'ry wall is broken down

And then none day in his presence

We will fill all heav'n with harmony

United for eternity, one God, one people, one voice

God gives us endurance with his mighty hand

So we can reach the lost ones, help the weak to stand

Encouraging and patient, growing day by day,

Following his footsteps as he guides our homeward way

So that withbone heart and with one voice, We may glorify the Father;

For through Jesus Christ his son, ev'ry wall is broken down

And then one day in his presence, We will fill all heav'n with harmony

United for eternity, one God, one people, one voice
