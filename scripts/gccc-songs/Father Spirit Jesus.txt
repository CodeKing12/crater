Chorus 1
You are worthy of all honor
Glory praise and power
King of the nations
You are holy God almighty
Clothed in brilliant majesty
Father Spirit Jesus

Verse 1
Lord the worship we bring
Is more than songs that we sing
It's a reflection of our ever changing lives
The best we have to offer
We don't just lift up our hands
Lord we lift up our lives
For we know that You are worthy of our praise
To You our lifesongs raise

BRIDGE
Rescued from darkness
We are walkin' in marvelous light
For we are children of the King
Sing
