WITH YOU MEDLEY

People looking for what's not lost

Helter skelter all around

Chasing after shadows

Not knowing You are close

The vacuum only you can fill

The space made by you and for you

When we come to the end of ourselves

And no where to go, else

For with you, is all I need

With you I have my peace

With you is my destiny

With you is everything

Lord prepare me

A sanctuary

Pure and Holy

Tried and true

With thanksgiving

I'll be a living Sanctuary

For You

This is the air I breathe

This is the air I breathe

Your holy presence living in me

This is my daily bread

This is my daily bread

Your very word spoken to me

And I I'm desperate for you

And I I'm lost without you
