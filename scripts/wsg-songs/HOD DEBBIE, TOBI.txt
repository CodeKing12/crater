Hmmm  hmmm  hmmm

OK OK

I have not come to judge you

I have not come to condemn you

I have not come to make you feel less of yourself

I have not come to encourage the fear raising its ugly head in you

I have not come to enrich  the negativity those

haggards permeated your mind which got in your spirit

I have not come to promote fear in your heart but to

shatter the faulty foundation laid by those haggards

Be not dismayed for I come bearing

the truth and nothing but the truth

Christians/believers / kingdom folks

I

wandering heart filled with the  lies of the old man

The lies you were fed by the

hungry wolves in sheep clothings..

Remember he told you

That the kingdom work is stress filled,

he told you you were not qualified,

deceived you to Labour for the meat that perish

He said the king's way is exhausting!

Daily giving you the Dose of

Schooling you on the LIFE diminishing Classes

He told you you could just do normal!

Fed you with gibberish of the flesh,

Each and everyday

The devil stands in your way to entice you,

giving you scoops of balderdash in exchange of the

Freely given LIFE ,to tease you ,

to tempt you!! Luring you into damnation

Gradually obtaining  the Gold

and replacing it with Ash, Dust!!

Christians you

Kingdom folks you

YES GOLD! not made from stone but from the heart of

the king himself that was why he died!

You accusers! Whispers,you are not good enough,

you are not special,you are not a spec

He says that your destiny cannot rise you cannot climb

up higher to where your king is

Lies! Lies !! Lies!!

I mean Lies upon lies the one the serpent told our

woman EVE in the garden: Have you thought about this

that death was not meant for human

God will never make me so

DLH
(Dark lovely and handsome)

just to let me die

So listen,death was not part of the plan

It was the fall of the great grand Father

that brought the punishment of death

Now Listen! Listen! I say listen

You are beautiful, Authentic, Adorable, a man after

God

created in his image! PRISTINE!

To go about doing Good!

Rise up to whom you are!

Get up on your feet, Stand; Rise up to responsibility

Wake up! You

Get over normalcy! Do the abnormalities

Get Born again! Stirred up as

Quickening Spirits

Win souls -Be Divine

Hot and ready to run through the King

God over the satanas; You are Christ

The anointed One and his anointing
