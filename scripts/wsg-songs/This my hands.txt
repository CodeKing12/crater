Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

This my hands,
they can heal the sick

They can raise the dead,
This my hands

Anything that they touch,
Surely turns to gold

This my hands


I
I am blessed

I carry power
In my hands

This my mouth, they can speak in tongues They can move mountains,

This my mouth Anything that it says,
Surely comes to pass

This my mouth

I

I carry power
In my hands

This my life, it

Unstoppable

This my life

Victory
Winning all the way,

more than a conqueror
It

Chorus

I

I carry power
In my hands
