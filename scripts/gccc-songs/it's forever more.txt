it's forever more
it's forever more
this worship to my saviour is forever more

it's forever more
it's forever more
the lifting of my hands is forever more

ever and ever
ever and ever
for you
I am for you

my life for you

my dance for you

Always for you

this song for you

this life for you

Forever for you

This boy for you
This girl for you

My days for you

For you For you

Ah ah ah ah

Eh eh eh eh
