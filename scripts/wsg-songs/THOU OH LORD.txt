VERSE1
Many are they increase
That trouble me

Many are they that rise up
Against me

Many they be which say of my soul

There is no help for me in God

Chorus
But thou oh lord art a shield for me

My glory and the lifter of my head

Thou oh lord art a shield for me

My glory and the lifter of my head

verse2
I cried unto the lord
With my voice

And he heard me out of his holy hill

He laid me down and slept and awake

For the lord sustained me

For he sustained me

Chorus
But thou oh lord art a shield for me

My glory and the lifter of my head

Thou oh lord art a shield for me

My glory and the lifter of my head

of my head

my head
