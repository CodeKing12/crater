All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small

All things wise and wonderful
The Lord God made them all

Each little flower that opens
Each little bird that sings

He made their glowing colors
And made their tiny wings

All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small

All things wise and wonderful
The Lord God made them all

The purple headed mountains
The rivers running by

The sunset and the morning
That brightens up the sky

All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small

All things wise and wonderful
The Lord God made them all

The cold wind in the winter
The pleasant summer sun

The ripe fruits in the garden
He made them every one

All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small

All things wise and wonderful
The Lord God made them all

He gave us eyes to see them
And lips that we might tell

How great is the Almighty
Who has made all things well

All things bright and beautiful
All creatures great and small

All things wise and wonderful
The Lord God made them all
