Where would I be if not for Your grace

O Lord I'll praise You all of my days

I'm standing here today

Because You've shown me love

Where would I be if not for grace

Your goodness and Your love surrounds me

Your peace and favour goes before me

I know I so deserve

You say that I am worthy

Where would I be if not for grace

You turn my mourning into dancing dancing

You turn my sorrows into joy

Over and o- ver again
