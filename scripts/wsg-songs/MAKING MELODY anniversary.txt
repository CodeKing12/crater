CHORUS
Making melody in our hearts to the King of Kings

With songs of harmony

We establish our praise

Shouts of jubilee from our lips to the Lord of Hosts

Raising a symphony

We establish our praise

VERSE 1
O sing a new song unto the Lord

For He hath done marvellous things

His right hand and His holy arm

Hath gotten Him the victory

Make a joyful noise unto the Lord

CHORUS
Making melody in our hearts to the King of Kings

With songs of harmony

We establish our praise

We establish our praise

Shouts of jubilee from our lips to the Lord of Hosts

Raising a symphony

We establish our praise

VERSE 2
O sing a new song unto the Lord

Tell of His Grace in all the earth

Speak of His Love all through the day

And of His works every night

Make a joyful noise unto the Lord

let everything that has breath praise the lord
