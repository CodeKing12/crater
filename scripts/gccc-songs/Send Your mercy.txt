Forgive me Oh Lord - It's me again
Forgive me Oh Lord - It's me again
I've disobeyed Your Word
I've slipped out of Your Will
Regretful I stand - me again

Forgive me Oh Lord - It's me again
Forgive me Oh Lord - It's me again
I've disobeyed Your Word
I've slipped out of Your Will
Remorseful I stand - me again

Send Your mercy
Down from Glory
Lord please purge me
Renew me - fix me again
