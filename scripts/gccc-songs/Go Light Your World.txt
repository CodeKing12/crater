Chorus 1
So carry your candle run to the darkness
Seek out the hopeless confused and torn
Hold out your candle for all to see it
Take your candle and go light your world
Take your candle and go light your world

Verse 1
There is a candle in every soul
Some brightly burning some dark and cold
There is a Spirit who brings a fire
Ignites a candle and makes His home

Verse 2
Frustrated brother see how he's tried to
Light his own candle some other way
See now your sister she's been robbed and lied to
Still holds a candle without a flame

Chorus 2
So carry your candle run to the darkness
Seek out the lonely the tired and worn
Hold out your candle for all to see it
Take your candle and go light your world
Take your candle and go light your world

Verse 3
We are a fam'ly whose hearts are blazing
So let's raise our candles and light up the sky
Praying to our Father in the name of Jesus
Make us a beacon in darkest times

Chorus 3
So carry your candle run to the darkness
Seek out the helpless deceived and poor
Hold out your candle for all to see it
Take your candle and go light your world
Carry your candle run to the darkness
Seek out the hopeless confused and torn
Hold out your candle for all to see it
Take your candle and go light your world
Take your candle and go light your world
