G.D TEENS CHOIR
MINISTERING
THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE

There's been a change

A great Change

There's been a change in my life

He changed the things that were wrong

He took away the pain

No long am I the same

And He brought me through a while

He change my name

That's what He's done for me

Now that I'm walking in the light

There is no darkness

Now that I've found Joy and Peace

There is no sadness

He took away the pain

No long am I the same

And He brought me through a while

He change my name

That's what He's done for me

Change

He's Changed my life
