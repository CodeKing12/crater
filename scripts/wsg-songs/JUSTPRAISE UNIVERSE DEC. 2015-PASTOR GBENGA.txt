POWER OF YOUR LOVE


Lord I come to You

Let my heart be changed, renewed

Flowing from the grace

That I found in You.

And Lord I've come to know

The weaknesses I see in me

Will be stripped away

By the power of Your love



Hold me close

Let Your love surround me

Bring me near

Draw me to Your side.

And as I wait

I'll rise up like the eagle

And I will soar with You

Your Spirit leads me on

In the power of Your love


Lord unveil my eyes

Let me see You face to face

The knowledge of Your love

As You live in me.

Lord renew my mind

As Your will unfolds in my life

In living every day

by the power of Your love.


And with our hands lifted high,

we will worship and sing.

And with our hands lifted high,

we come before You rejoicing

With our hands lifted high to the sky,

when the world wonders why

We'll just tell them we're loving our King
