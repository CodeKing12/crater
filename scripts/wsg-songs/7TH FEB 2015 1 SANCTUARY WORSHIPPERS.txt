SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

All i see is you...
As i worship and adore you

I yield myself to you

This is where i want to be
In your presence oh God

As i listen for your voice...
You refresh my soul my spirit

I yield myself to you
This is where i want to be

In your presence oh God

I loose myself... soaring high
like an eagle

And as you carry me
With the wings of the spirit

you're in control...

All i need is you lord

Is you lord

All i need is you

Better days are here
I

A new day is here,
I have a fresh expectation

Got a new perspective
And it

I
But only what i hear

Call: I hear
Resp: greater

Call: in my ear i hear, i hear
Resp: greater
Greater, greater for my life

God
And it will last
If he says it

It

Got a new perspective
And it

I
But only what I hear

Call: I hear
Resp: greater

Call: in my ear I hear, I hear
Resp: greater
Greater, greater for my life
