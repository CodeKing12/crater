WORSHIPPERS

Everything I am is all because of you

It's all because of you

That's why I sing to you....

Because of you

Every other thing go make sense...

Because of you

Every other thing go make sense..

Baba na you...

Love ngidi kwegu

When I think about the things you do

Your love dey make me dey follow you

Baba na you biko

Na only you
ewo ewo
