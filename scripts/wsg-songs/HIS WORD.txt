HIS WORD

I believe his word
I receive his word

He promised me a change
And I believe it

I proclaim his word
Standing on his word

He promised me a change
And I receive it

All of my past is gone

All hurt and pain is gone

Everything is changed for me

Everything is changed for me

Everything is changed

Nothing is the same

Everything is changed for me
