This is the day
That the Lord has made
Its by His grace and His
So therefore we sing/ I sing
We sing Again
Again and again
Saying

I shall not be consumed
I shall not be removed
I shall not be consumed
I shall not be removed

I shall not be denied
The Lord is my shepherd
What could/will I ever want
I shall not be refused
I shall not be denied
The Lord is my shepherd
What could/will I ever want
I shall not be refused
