VERSE 1
I gave My life for thee,
My precious blood I shed,

That thou mightst ransomed be,
And quickened from the dead;

I gave, I gave My life for thee,
What hast thou done for Me?


VERSE 2
My Father's house of light,
My glory-circled throne

I left for earthly night,
For wanderings sad and lone;

I left my all for thee,
Hast thou left aught for Me?


VERSE 3
I suffered much for thee,
More than thy tongue can tell,

Of bitterest agony,
To rescue thee from hell;

I've borne, it all for thee,
What hast thou borne for Me?


VERSE 4
And I have brought to thee,
Down from My home above,

Salvation full and free,
My pardon and My love;

I bring rich gifts to thee,
What hast thou brought to Me?
