No words to say
Just want to stay At your feet

Gazing at your face
Just want to stay At your feet

No words to say
Just want to stay at your feet

Gazing at your face
Just want to stay at your feet

Every thing else that happens

Outside your presence, Is just noise pure noise

Oh  Oh Oh...

All that matters is here

Because all matters is here
