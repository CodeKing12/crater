My heart says yes yes yes
Forever yes
To the lover of my soul
And with one single heart

You can can type on it
You can move through it
You can ride on it
My heart says yes
And with one single heart

You can sing through it
You can speak through it
You can move on it
My heart says yes
And with one single heart

You can sing through it
You can speak through it
You can move on it
My heart says yes
And with one single heart
