When we speak we speak as the oracle of God
Cuz we serve a God that lives within us

Wherever I go I preach the Gospel
To whoever I see till you become full

Ion gotta talk the Lord defends me
I hear them all saying abeg you

Cuz me and all my angels shut the demons up
While they were tryna pull me down I levelled up

I levelled up twice
I levelled up Life Class

God made it clear to them saying
So now I win souls and make the heavens proud

Prepare for miracles blessings in this time
We Save them grow them maintain them empower them

For anyone ready to take Life class  Give them
I breathe God

Got the power of the word coming out of my tongue
