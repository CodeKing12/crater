This is the air I breathe
This is the air I breathe
Your holy presence
Living in me/2/

This is my daily bread
This is my daily bread
Your very word
Spoken to me

And I... I'm desparate
And I... I'm lost without

This is air I breathe
Your holy presence

Living in me
This is my daily bread
This is my daily bread
Your very word
Spoken to me
And I... I'm desparate
And I... I'm lost without
you
