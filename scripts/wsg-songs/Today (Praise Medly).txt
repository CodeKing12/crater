You are my hiding place
In your presence I am safe

I can run to you when I visit
Don

Feding so confused that
When you are right beside me but I

Can
Has got me overwhelmed

You are my peace and safety you hide me
King jzee will take care of me

I
In heavenly places, in the earth above the sea

Their weapons my form but they can
-

Hide me lord in your presence
Hide me lord, hide me lord

In your presence I am safe
-

That all your goodness I will see
And if it had not been for you

Standing on my side where would I be
-

If not for your grace
I don

If not for your kindness,
I never could say I

If not for your mercy
If not for your love

I most likely would have given up
If not for your favour

I never could say I
But by the grace of God

Oooooo

I
I

Hey hey hey

Giant, they die
The bigger they are, the harder they fall

Giant, they die
Just walk around the Jericho wall

Now we come in your name
And we stand on your word

What we loose in the heaven shall be
Loosed on earth.

Let God arise Giant

Hey hey hey

Your praise will bring down strongholds
When you praise you

Just praise when things seem impossible
And the king or Glory will show himself on you

When you praise, just praise
When you praise they gonna come down

They gonna come down
Let God arise, Giant die

Today, I
I run too far to still be the same

See who I was I give him away
Today

Today no longer bound by what people say
I know that I will make mistakes

I fall but I refuse to stay
Today

I have been waiting all my life to get to the door
And now it


They are alive for so much more
Help somebody
Heal somebody

Free somebody
Forgive somebody

Touch somebody
Love somebody

Catch somebody
Let go of somebody

Today, I see the hurt upon your face
Thinking how much more of this can I take

In a minutes I
Today

See the pain, has purpose so don
Throw it away

There is a harvest if ya only wait
Don

Through you
Like this before

But if what you see is all you see
You will miss theirs is much more

Help somebody
Heal somebody

Free somebody
Forgive somebody

Touch somebody
Love somebody

Catch somebody
Let go of somebody

Hey hey hey

Give the praise to Jesus
Give it

This is your house
This is your place

Dwell there oh lord
Oh lord our God.
