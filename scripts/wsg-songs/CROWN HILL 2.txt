MINISTERING
PURE WORSHIP

My life is lifted up

My life is ready to serve

A man of God

My hands are lifted up

My heart is ready to receive

A blessing from you

Make me
Shape me
Mould me
Use me

My heart is ready to receive

A blessing from you

I'm turning away from the things that I do that i know aren't pleasing in your sight

And the things that I know aren't right

I'm turning away from the mess of my heart

And shame of the things that has me bound

I'm turning away

If you provide the fire,
I will provide the sacrifice

If you pour out your spirit,
I will open up inside

Fill me up God...

Fill me up!

I love you forever...

I love you forever,
Lord

We give glory to God

Glory to God,
Forever

I love you forever...

I love you forever,
Lord
