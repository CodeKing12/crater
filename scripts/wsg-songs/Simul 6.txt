I CAN HEAR MY SAVIOUR CALLING

I can hear my Savior calling,
In the tend
On my ear these words are falling,
â€œ

I will take my cross and follow,
My dear Savior I will follow,
Where He leads me I will follow,
I

Though the way be dark and dreary,
Though my feet be worn and weary,
Yet my heart keeps bright and cheery
As I follow, follow all the way.

Savior, ever go before me,
Shining heaven
And when weak, by grace restore me
As I follow, follow all the way.
