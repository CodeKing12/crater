VERSE1
Oh Lord my God

You are my king and I bow my knees

In reverence Lord for you I live

All that I am all I have

is for your glory

is for your grace

CHORUS
The heavens tremble

Mountains skip and walls fall

In your presence

You are God alone

I lift my hands,
I lift my all to you

I lift my voice to say

I am yours

VERSE2
Lord there's no beside thee

You are El Elyon

The Lord most high

I bow to you

We adore your name

BRIDGE
Time and time again you've proven

Your sovereignty

Your majesty

You don't need a man to be the God you are

That's your sovereignty

That's your majesty

TAG
There's nobody like you

There's no one beside you

My victory is in you

My whole life is in you

CHORUS
The heavens tremble

Mountains skip and walls fall

In your presence

You are God alone

I lift my hands,
I lift my all to you

I lift my voice to say

I am yours
