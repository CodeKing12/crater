You call me out upon
The great unknown
And there I find You in
In oceans deep my faith

And I will call upon Your
And keep my eyes
When oceans rise
My soul will rest in Your
For I am Yours and You

Your grace abounds in
Your sovereign hand will
Where feet may fail and
You've never failed and

So I will call upon Your
And keep my eyes
When oceans rise
My soul will rest in Your
For I am Yours and You

Spirit lead me where my
Let me walk upon the
Wherever You would call
Take me deeper than my
And my faith will be
In the presence of my
Saviour
