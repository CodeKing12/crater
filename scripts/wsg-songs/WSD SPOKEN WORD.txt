What is wrong with these people?

I'm in labor.

I feel unexplainable pains.

I'm in great travail.

When will these people come to the reality of the truth?

I am tired!

I am weak and there's no strength left in me again.

Brothers and Sisters.

When will you stop all these complaints?

When will you stop transferring from one church to the other?

And don't be wishing you were someplace else

or with someone else.

Where you are right now is God's place for you.

Live and obey and love and believe right there.

The Assignment is not about where

and who you're comfortable with.

It is about manifesting as Sons

no matter the circumstances and challenges

As Sons and Daughters of God, we are all in travail

As Disciples of Jesus...

the one whom death could not hold captive.

The one who went to hell.

Broke its gates and conquered death

The one who could say it is finished on the cross.

The one who finished his assignment here on Earth

As Heirs who will sit on the throne

and receive Crowns of Righteousness.

As one whom the Earth has been given

to as our Place of Purpose.

The Earth is our place of Manifestation.

Because there's no Manisfetation elsewhere...
