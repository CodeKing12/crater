We are praising Yahweh
Yahweh this worship is for You
Yahweh see the lifting of my holy hands
It's unto You, it's unto You, alone

Yahweh see the lifting of my holy hands
It's unto You, it's unto You, alone

It's unto You, it's unto You, alone

You picked me up from the miry clay
You set my feet on the rock to stay
just a pauper now you made a king
you put your crown now upon my head

who am i without you lord
all i have i got from you
all i have for you is praise
all you have for me is love

all of my praise is for you

only you yahweh
