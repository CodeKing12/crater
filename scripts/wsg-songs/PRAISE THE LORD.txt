verse 1
When you

That shatters all your dreams

And your hope are cruelly crushed by satan

When you feel the urge within to submit to
earthly fears

Don

Chorus
Praise the lord

He can work with those who praise him

Praise the lord for our God inhabits praise

Praise the lord

For the chains that seems to bind you

Serves only to remind you

They

When you praise him

verse 2
Satan is a liar

When he tries to make you think that you

Though if he know himself

You

So lift up the mighty shield of faith

For the battle is already won

You know that Jesus Christ is risen

And the work is already done.
