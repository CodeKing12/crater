You will do what no man can do

You will give what no man can give

You will bless what no man can bless

I have no other God but you

Covenant keeping God there is no one like you

Alpha, Omega, there is no one like you

I have seen the Lord's goodness,
his mercies and compassion

I have seen the Lord's goodness,
Hallelujah, Praise the Lord

Oh Lord you have been so good,
You are so good to me

Oh Lord you are excellent in my life everyday

Oh Lord you are excellent in my life
