There Is A King In You

You come from Royalty,

An aristocratic dynasty

The goal of the enemy,

Is that you don't know who you are

There's power when you speak

Be mindful of words you release

I know that life has challenged you,

But the King in me speaks to the King in you

You were born to rule

There is a king in you

Is there no King in you?

Then why do you speak, speak with such defeat

Is there no King in you,

Then why do you speak, speak with such low esteem

I know that life has challengd you,

But the King in me speaks to the King in you

You were born to rule

There is a king in you

There is a King in you
