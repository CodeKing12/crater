Generations after Generations
Keep Praising you Yet no Word Sums you Up

Then I asked the Lord What Name Fits You
And He said YAH

Generations after Generations
Keep Praising you Yet no Word Sums you Up

Then I asked the Lord What Name Fits You
And He said YAH

YAH, the Hallowed One
YAH, the Holy One

YAHWEH, the King of Zion
YAH, The Hallowed One

YAH, the Holy One
YAHWEH, the King of Zion

Generations after Generations
Keep Praising you Yet no Word Sums you Up

Then I asked the Lord What Name Fits You
And He said YAH

Generations after Generations
Keep Praising you Yet no Word Sums you Up

Then I asked the Lord What Name Fits You
And He said YAH

Generations after Generations
Keep Praising you Yet no Word Sums you Up

Then I asked the Lord What Name Fits You
And He said YAH

Generations after Generations
Keep Praising you Yet no Word Sums you Up

And He said YAH

YAH, the Hallowed One
YAH, the Holy One

YAHWEH, the King of Zion

YAH, The Hallowed One
YAH, the Holy One
