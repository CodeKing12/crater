All my life You have been faithful

All my life You have been so, so good

With every breath that I am able

I will sing of the goodness of God

so from the pages of my heart

let my worship begin

and never end

to the God of all flesh

for he's my God

and his name is yahweh

I worship You,

with all my heart,

With all my heart

I lift my hands,

with all my heart,

With all my heart

I love You Lord,

with all my heart,

With all my heart.

I give You praise,

with all my heart,

With all my heart

there's a miracle in this room

with my name on it

there's a blessing in this room

with my name on it

so i'm gonna put a praise on it

i'm gonna put a praise on it
