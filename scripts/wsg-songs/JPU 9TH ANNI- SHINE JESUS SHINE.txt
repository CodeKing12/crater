Lord, the Light of Your Love is shining,

In the midst of the darkness shining,

Jesus, Light of the World, shine upon us,

Set us free by the truth You now bring us,

Shine on me,
Shine on me

Shine, Jesus shine,
Fill this land with the Father's glory

Blaze, Spirit blaze,
Set our hearts on fire

Flow, river flow,
Flood the nations with grace and mercy

Send forth Your word,
Lord and let there be light

So our faces display Your likeness

Ever changing from glory to glory,

Mirrored here may our lives tell Your story

Shine on me,
Shine on me

Fill this land with the Father's glory
