Give me one pure and holy passion
Give me one magnificent obsession
Give me one glorious ambition for my life, Lord
To know and follow hard after you (hard after you)

To know and follow hard after you
(To know and follow hard after you)
To grow as your disciple in your truth
(To grow as your disciple)
This world is empty, pale and poor
Compared to knowing you my Lord
Lead me on and I will run after you
Lead me on and I will run after you

I have decided to follow Jesus
Wooh!
I have decided to follow Jesus

Lead me on and I will run after you
Lead me on and I will run after you
(Ooooh)
