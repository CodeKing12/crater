There is a name above all names

The name of Jesus a refuge from pain

His arms are opened

His love is free for he came to break all chains of sin

Oh yes he came to set us on the throne

Oh yes he came to set us on the throne

Come unto me

Come unto me

Come unto me

And you'll never hunger or thirst again

Come unto me

Come unto me

Come unto me

And I'll freely give you rest

Cause the name of the Lord is a strong tower

Those who trust in the Lord are never shamed

Believe in the name of the Lord

And confess he's Lord and be saved

Submit to the name of the Lord

Uh uh.....in the name of the Lord

Uh..... in the name

The counsel of the Lord is in my heart
