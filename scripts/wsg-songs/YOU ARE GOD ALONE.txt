VERSE1
You are not a God created by human hand

You are not a God dependent on any mortal man

You are not a God in need of anything we can give

By your plan that is just the way it is

CHORUS
You are God alone
From before time begin

You are on your throne
You are God alone

And right now
In the good times and good

You are on your throne
You are God alone

VERSE 2
You
None can contend

You
And praise will never end

You

Of everything we can give

You are God
And that is just the way it is

CHORUS
You are God alone
From before time begin

You are on your throne
You are God alone

And right now
In the good times and good

You are on your throne
You are God alone

BRIDGE
Unchangeable, Unshakeable, Unstoppable

That
â€™
?s who you are
