THE INCENSE AND IT'S CENSER

Tag 1
Perforated Pierced, Punctured Pruned

And Oh! we know exactly what your thoughts are..

Our HOLES attracts your attention

And you're wondering what we are...

Tag 2
The WAYS of our Fumes Marvels You,

And you think there might just be more...

The Flames of our Fuming Fire Bewildered you,

And you think we just might be Dottily Nut...

Our Manner of Speech, Our Order of Service.

Our Choice of Bread, Our Mode of Worship...

You could not shy away from this Wonderment,

But you think it's just another SCHEME for Dissimulation.

Tag 3
Oh No!

We are nothing lite the flickers of your imagination.

This is Who we are;

We are the once rigid Steel

Shaped by the TRUTH of the WHITE BLACKSMITH.

Yes! We are the once buried Gold

Graced by the fire of the GRAND GOLDSMITH

Tag 4
We are Kings, Oh Yes! We are Priests.

Verbosely Wroughted in God's Versatility.

Prudishly Drown in the Ointment of Divinity.

We are the pure Hearts,

Nurtured in the readiness of hearing.

We are the clean Heads,

Fermented in the Oil of Leadership.

Sanctified, Purified and Consecrated,

For the Most Holy Affairs...

Tag 5
We are the CENSER

The Infallible Temple of Holiness

Stricken Through Thoroughly with The Nail of Truth;

That Very Nail of The Lord once referenced as a Carpenter's Son.

And as A CENSER, our once sieged Nation,
Became a Generous border of Good Givers..

In Sacrifice.. In Selflessness..

We were Clothed in HOLES for Service...

And Crowned with Hanger for Holy Obligations..

We are the INCENSE

A Scent Broken down from a Mundane Tree

Burned with the Exercise of the Spirit..

To grow tall to the height of Divinity..

A Pillar of Cloud in Truth for Day..

A Pillar of Fire for Life by Night.

Ignited with Fire, Majestic in Flames.

Manifold in Expression, Enveloped in Life.

Chaste in Character, Crude in Truth.

Vast in Capacity..Fountain of Love.

So GLORIOUS,  And Ever Pleasing for a Sweet Receipt to God.

Oh Yes!

We are THE CENSER AND IT'S INCENSE

The Glory Filling The Earth;

Covering The NATIONS

Saturating The HEARTS...

We are the RoyalPriesthood

Raised in DUE ORDER

One with Christ,  And One in God

We Are The Sent Ones.

The  CENSER and its INCENSE!!!
