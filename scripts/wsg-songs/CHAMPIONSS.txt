Whoah oh oh whoa oh oh

I am a winner I am victorious

I can do all things yes I can

I am triumphing nothing is holding me

I overcome by the blood of the lamb


I overcome by his blood

I was born a champion

I am bold and strong

I was born[a champion]



Greater is he that is in me

I was born a champion

I was once bound but now am freed

I



Oh I overcome by the blood of the lamb


Champion lives within me

He

I

I overcome by the blood of the lamb

Ye ye ye.......
