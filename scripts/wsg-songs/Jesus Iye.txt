Jesus Iye

You Have Done It Again

Jesus Iye

In Your Special Way

What Was Impossible

You've Made Possible

Jesus Iye

I Almost Gave Up

When It Seemed It Was Impossible

When The Odds Were Up Against Me

And There Was No Way

It Seemed All Over

Then You Spoke Into The Dry Bones

What Was Impossible

You've Made Possible
