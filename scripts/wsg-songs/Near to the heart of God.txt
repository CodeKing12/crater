There is a place of quiet rest

Near to the heart of God

A place where sin cannot molest

Near to the heart of God

O Jesus blest redeemer

Sent from the heart of God

Hold us who wait before thee

Near to the heart of God

There is a place of comfort sweet

Near to the heart of God

A place where we our Savior meet

Near to the heart of God

O Jesus blest redeemer

Sent from from the heart of God

Hold us who wait before thee

Near to the heart of God

There is a place of full release

Near to the heart of God

A place where all is joy and peace

Near to the heart of God

O Jesus blest redeemer

Sent from from the heart of God

Hold us who wait before thee

Near to the heart of God

Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

Near to the heart of God
