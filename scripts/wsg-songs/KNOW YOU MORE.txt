Precious Jesus
What a mighty God I serve

Precious Jesus
On your solid Rock I stand

Precious Jesus
You are worthy to be praised

Precious Jesus
I am made whole by your grace

I'm gonna serve you Lord

To know you more
There were times that I felt so hopeless

O yea yea

There were times that I felt so helpless
And you show your love towards me

And your grace towards me
Thank you Lord for everything you have done

I want to know more
To know you more

I want to know you more
In my life journey

I want to know you more
In word sanctuary

I want to know you more
You are my everything

I want to know more
You are the king of kings
