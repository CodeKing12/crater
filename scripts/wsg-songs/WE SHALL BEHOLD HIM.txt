WSMCI
MINISTERING
WE SHALL BEHOLD HIM

The sky shall unfold, preparing his entrance

The stars shall applaud him with thunders of praise

The sweet light in his eyes shall enhance those awaiting

And we shall behold him, then face to face.


Oh we shall behold him, yes we shall behold him

Face to face in all of his glory

Oh we shall behold him, yes we shall behold him

Face to face our savior and lord.

And the angels shall sound the shout of his coming

And the sleeping shall rise from their slumbering place

And those remaining shall be changed in a moment

And we shall behold him, then face to face

We shall behold him, yes, we shall behold him

Face to face in all of his glory

We shall behold him, yes, we shall behold him

Face to face, our savior and lord

We shall behold him, our savior and lord
Savior and lord.
