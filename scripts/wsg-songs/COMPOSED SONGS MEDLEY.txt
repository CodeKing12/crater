COMPOSED SONGS MEDLEY

verse 1
I have access to the Father

I am one with him

I have access to the Spirit of God

verse 2
You are my breathe, You are my life, You are my passion.

verse 3
I'm transformed by you

I've been made brand new

Since you came, I've been changed

No more sin and shame

You took it all away

Since you came, My life changed

verse 4
For your kingdom will endure, Endure as the sun

And your kingdom will remain, Forever more

Exalted Father, Our eternal Father

You reign you rule

For thine is the kingdom, The power and the glory

You reign forever, Your throne is established

Your laws are forever, Your word is eternal

You reign.....
