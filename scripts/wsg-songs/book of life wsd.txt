This is the story of a brother
Who slept and woke up in Foreverland

He looked around, nothing's familiar
He wondered how he got to be there

He took a walk around the city
And saw this brick house with a small door

Walked into the room and saw a man in white
Must be an Angel so he said

"Mr. Angel I'm a stranger, I don't know what's going on
The last thing I remember was I slept last night"

This is a border town that takes you where you get a crown
Must have heard of Heaven where you came from

Only those whose name I find
Written in this book of life

Will forever be in Paradise

Is your name in this book of life?
Is your name in this book of life here?

Is your name in this book of life?
Is your name in this book of life here?

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

Flipping the pages of this great book
This brother gave a cursory gaze

He saw the names of prophets, saints and martyrs
Who kept the faith and won the race

But he said "Mr. Angel, where is my name?"
"Can you tell me what is going wrong?"

"I'm a pillar in my local church
Give the offerings and the tithes

Feed the poor and have myself a good name"

Is my name in this book of life?
Is my name in this book of life here?

Tell me is my name in this book of life?
Is my name in this book of life here?

Unforgiveness lurks within your heart
Some folks that you will never let go

Little foxes and secret faults
Will spring surprises on that final day

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

So much for this wonder brother
What about you?, What about me?

Let him who thinks that he stands
Let him take heed lest he falls

Only the pure in heart will see Jesus
Those whose garment glow with purity

Is your name in that book of life?
Is your name in that book of life there?

Is your name in that book of life?
Tell me is your name in that book of life there?

Think about it
