There is a witness in my belly
It flows like a river
A witness in my belly
Shows me where to go

I've got this witness
It's inside my belly
Flows like a river
A witness in my belly
It shows where to go

River river river
Belly belly belly
Out of my belly
Shall flow rivers of living  waters

River river river
Belly belly belly
Out of my belly
Shall flow eternal life

I trust the witness in my belly
It flows like a river
I trust the witness in my belly
It shows me where to go
