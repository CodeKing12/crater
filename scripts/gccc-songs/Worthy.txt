Verse
With my heart I cry to You
With my soul I thirst for You
With my flesh I die to You
Holy One, Holy One, I come to You

With my lips I shout to You
With my hands I reach to You
With my knees I bow to You
Holy One, Holy One, I come to You

Chorus
You are worthy Lord
You are worthy
You are worthy Lord
You are worthy
