MINISTERING
CHANGED

VERSE
Feels like I've been down the river

You washed away all my shame

No longer bound because I'm forgiven

I've been made free from sin's guilty stain

BRIDGE
You gave your life for me
That I might be saved

You changed my destiny

With the awesome price you paid
now I can say

CHORUS
Old things are passed away

All things are new

I'm not the same

Yes I've been changed
Yeah

It's true I found my life in you

All things are new

I'm not the same

Yes I've been changed, Yeah

VERSE 2
Mind's renewed no longer a sinner

No greater love have I ever known

And I've got power to walk like a winner

I can't fail 'cause He calls me his own

BRIDGE
You gave your life for me that I might be saved

You changed my destiny with the awesome price you paid,

Now I can say...

CHORUS
Old things are passed away

All things are new

I'm not the same

Yes I've been changed
Yeah

It's true I found my life in you

All things are new

I'm not the same

Yes I've been changed
Yeah
