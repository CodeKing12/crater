Oh Lord, my God
When I, in awesome
Consider all the worlds
Thy power throughout

Then sings my soul, my
How great Thou art, how
Then sings my soul, my
How great Thou art, how

And when I think that
Sent Him to die, I scarce
That on the cross, my
He bled and died to take

Then sings my soul, my
How great Thou art, how
Then sings my soul, my
How great Thou art, how

When Christ shall come,
And take me home, what
And then proclaim, my

Then sings my soul, my
How great Thou art, how
Then sings my soul, my
How great Thou art, how
How great Thou art, how
great Thou art
