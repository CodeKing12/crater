There
No, not one! no, not one!
None else could heal all our souls
No, not one! no, not one!

Jesus knows all about our struggles;
He will guide
There
No, not one! no, not one!

No friend like Him is so high and holy,
No, not one! no, not one!
And yet no friend is so meek and lowly,
No, not one! no, not one!

There
No, not one! no, not one!
No night so dark, but His love can cheer us,
No, not one! no, not one!
