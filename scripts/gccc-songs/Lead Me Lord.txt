Chorus 1
Lead me Lord I will follow
Lead me Lord I will go
You have called me I will answer
Lead me Lord I will go

Verse 1
It's hard to take the first step
When I don't know the way
Each turn is so uncertain
I learn to walk by faith
But You gave me a promise
That You would never leave
You will lead and guide me
Oh Lord I do believe

Verse 2
Your plans for me are perfect
I never need to fear
For though at times I feel alone
I know that You are near
My heart just wants to follow
I'm willing to obey
Take my hand and lead me
I'll follow all the way

ENDING
You have called me I will answer
Lead me Lord I will go
You have called me I will answer
Lead me Lord Lord I will go
Lead me Lord
