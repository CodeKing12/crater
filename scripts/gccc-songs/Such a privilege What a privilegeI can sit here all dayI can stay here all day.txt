It's a privilege
Such a privilege
One on one with Jesus
One on one with Jesus

Such a privilege
What a privilege
One on one with Jesus
One on one with Jesus

Such a privilege
What a privilege
Just to sit at your feet
Just to gaze at your face

Such a privilege
What a privilege
I can sit here all day
I can stay here all day

Such a privilege
What a privilege
I can sit here all day
I can stay here all day
