Great and marvelous are Your
Oh, Lord God Almighty
Great and marvelous are Your
Oh, Lord God Almighty
Just and true are Your ways
Oh, King of the Ages
Who shall not fear, oh Lord
And glorify Your name

For You alone
You alone are Holy
All nations will come
And worship before You, Lord
For You alone
You alone are Holy
All nations will come
And worship before You, Lord
Your righteous ways have been
You alone are Holy
