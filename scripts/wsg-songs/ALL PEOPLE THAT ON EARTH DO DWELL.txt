MINISTERING
ALL PEOPLE THAT ON EARTH DO DWELL

VERSE 1
All people that on earth do dwell
Sing to the lord with cheerful voice
Him serve with mirth his praise forthtell
Come ye before him and rejoice.

VERSE 2
The Lord ye know is God in deed
Without an aid he did us make
We are his folks he doth us feed
And for his sheep he doth us take

VERSE 3
O enter thru' his gates with praise
Approach with joy his courts into
Praise, laud and bless his name always
For it is seemly so to do.

VERSE 4
To father, son and Holy Ghost
The God whom heaven and earth adore
From men and from his angel-host
Be praise and glory ever more.
AMEN!!!
