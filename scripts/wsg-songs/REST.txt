MINISTERING
THERE REMAINETH A REST

There remaineth a rest,
A rest

For the people of God

A promise,
A finished work

And we must guard it with our heart

Everything you will ever need,
Was provided at Calvary

There remaineth a rest,
There is a rest

There remaineth a rest

There is a rest

A Rest

The finished work of the Lord

There remaineth a rest,
a rest

For the people of God

A promise,
A finished work

And we must guard it with our heart

Everything you will ever need,
Was provided at Calvary

There remaineth a rest,
There is a rest

There remaineth a rest,
There is a rest

A Rest

The finished work of the Lord

Cursed is any man that hangeth on a tree

Jesus Christ took on this curse,
Just for you and me

A curse is defined as poverty,
Sickness and death

When Jesus said it is finished,
He blessed us with his rest

There is a rest

There remaineth a rest,
There is a rest

There remaineth a rest,
There is a rest

A Rest, the finished work of the Lord

Now that you know that it's finished

Come on by faith lets go in it

Now that you know that it's finished

Come on by faith let's go in it

Go in it

Now that you know that it's finished

Come on by faith let's go in it

Now that you know that it's finished

Come on by faith lets go in it

There remaineth a rest,
There is a rest

A Rest....

A Finished Work of the Lord
