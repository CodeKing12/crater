This is the testament that God is good

And there is nothing Juju can do

His blood speaks better things than that of Abel

We stand Galant because our senior man is able

He who speaks to mountain and they move

And to dead dreams he said talitha cumi

We asked for mercy but on top Calvary mercy full

He who is merciful and good

This is a testament that Jehovah is always good

I

This is proof that the fountain of life is the giver of life

This is why we thirst and drink of him to survive

We have seven oceans

yet you chose my belly to flow rivers of living water

Have you met with the Agunaechemba?

The lion that guards the universe

When I run out of business

he stands as my chamber of commerce

Consistent King, you don

Yet when body dey hot you come as wind

Even if you try give zobo, it must turn to wine

This is the miracle that it is impossible for God to lie

Are we not proof that such a God lives

That such a God is merciful and is why we call him King

The consistent one

I need you to see his faithfulness in Hebrews 12:1

Surrounded with a cloud of witnesses

I see an army of Angels and the host of heaven shouting

Holy, Holy, Holy

Who will say that those Born of God are alone

Even in the depth of sin

I see the Master all around me

It

Master of the universe

I seek to master your nature in this verse

I seek to follow your course without taking a reverse, I

I seek to serve

Become as intimate as an intercourse

Since it

Before a virus infects the entire world

I want to show the planet we are already planted as planned at first

And not by some theoretical research

Even as dark as the moon

I can

His moon was also made to shine

Astronomy wouldn

Even if I studied a star, it would lead me right back to him

I could ask the wise men

But I seek the face of the wise God

In whom is the gallery of galaxies

Because when his glory comes

Dead things must come back to life

when they encounter the resurrection and the life

Men must hunger and thirst after righteousness

Then eat of the bread of life

The devil has come to steal, kill and destroy

But he has come that we may have life

For he has given us everything that pertains unto life

See the words that I speak

see they are spirit and they are life

Now who dares control your joy Omo Ayo

Even on a rainy day the sun would rise

Hotter than atarodo and spice, so why wouldn

We must see your incisors smile

Nothing stops like menopause except you do play or pause

Break the bank with big figures

It

Embody the legend of the seeker, Zeddicus

Hit every beat like Ozedikus

Nwanne

So it

Eat my words like Edikaikong and anybody try to tear you down

You pull up because na you be King Kong

Nobody

You

For who can stand against the alagbada ina

The one who is clothed in fire

For does he speak and then not act?

Does he promise and not fulfill?

To search his understanding is impossible

He

Every other God is a poor imitation of his being and nature
