Out of thee proceeds bread and wine
Out of thee proceeds kings and priests

Oh oh oh oh


We are kings and priests the throne life is our life oh oh oh oh oh oh
We are kings and priests with crowns on our head oh oh oh oh oh oh

We Reign

Cause You Reign
You Reign

Holy Holy King of kings
Fire Fire kings and priests

Majesty you reign
Victorious you prevail

You have set me on your throne
For me is just to reign as you reign

Hallelujah


He has won, won, won
And I won with him

And the Life I live
I live through Him
