Love divine all loves excelling
joy of Heav
fix in us thy humble dwelling
all thy faithful mercies crown
Jesus thou art all compassion
pure unbounded love thou
Visit us with thy salvation
enter every trembling heart

Breathe O breathe thy loving
into every troubled breast
Let us all in thee inherit
let us find thy promised rest
Take away the love of
Alpha and Omega be
End of faith as its beginning
set our hearts at liberty

Come Almighty to deliver
let us all thy life recieve
Graciously return and never,
Then we would be always
serve thee as they hosts
pray and praise thee without
glory in thy precious  love

Finish then thy new creation
Pure and spotless let us be
Let us see thy great salvation
Changed from glory unto
till in heaven we take our
till we cast our crowns before
lost in wonder love and
