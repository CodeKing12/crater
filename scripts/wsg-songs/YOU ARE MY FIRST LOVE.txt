I'm returning to the secret place

Just an altar and a flame

Love is found here in our sacred space

I hear Your voice, I see Your face

You are my first love

You are my only one

You are my first love

You are my only one

There's a table just for You and me

Break the bread and pour the wine

Perfect union, nothing in between

I am Yours and You are mine

You are my first love

You are my only one

You are my first love

You are my only one

I feel my heart beating out of my chest

I wanna stay forever like this

May the flame of my heart always be lit

I wanna burn forever like this

I feel my heart beating out of my chest

I wanna stay forever like this

May the flame of my heart always be lit

I wanna burn forever like this

You are my first love

You are my only one

You are my first love

You are my only one

You are my first love

You are my only one

You are my first love

You are my only one

I feel my heart beating out of my chest

I wanna stay forever like this

May the flame of my heart always be lit

I wanna burn forever like this

Your love is wide

Your love is wide for me

Your love is wide

Your love is wide for me

Your love is wide

Your love is wide for me

Your love is wide

Your love is wide for me

Your love is wide

Your love is wide for me

Your love is wide

Your love is wide for me

Your love is wide

Your love is wide for me

Your love is wide

Your love is wide for me

Your love is wide

Your love is wide for me

Your love is wide

Your love is wide for me

Your love is wide

Your love is wide for me

Your love is wide

Your love is wide for me

Your love is wide

Your love is wide for me

Your love is wide

Your love is wide for me
