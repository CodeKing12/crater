Verse 2

In the midnight hour

I was searching for the power

Cause I needed my mountain

Crushed into bits and powder

Like a balm you took away my pain

Picked up when I called your name

I was way way down in shame

â€˜

I won before I started the the game

It

It

Because of You

I live my life brand new

Adonai, Adonai, Adonai

Adonai, Adonai, Adonai

We call You Adonai

Adonai, Adonai, Adonai

Adonai, Adonai, Adonai

Lord we stand amazed at the beauty of Your words
