Cleverly he made me

God you're describable

In your image and likeness

I am made

When I muse about creation

And the wondrous things you've made

Lord you're great

I am great

You're so great

Great in your ways

Your wisdom so great

You're so great

Great in your ways

Your wisdom so great

Holy Spirit you're in us

Holy Spirit you're in us

I won't cleave to another

nor lean on any man

Holy Spirit you're in us

I will sing your praises

And I'll tell of your greatness

For through the earth your mighty acts we see

And you made me a God as you

And you've shown to me your ways

LORD you're great

I am great

I will never be

Never be satisfied so here I am

Fill me up with your glory

I'm desperate for more

I'm desperate for more

I'm desperate for more

and more and more of you LORD
