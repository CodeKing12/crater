Unending Love

I think I
Trapped in the chains of a man

That I
And in spite of my intelligence

I can
Furthermore; explain

The reasons behind the fact
That I think I

Constantly drowning
In an ocean of Love

With a raging tempest
Antagonizing my flaws to the floor

Burning with the flame
That seems to be endless

A love that is reckless
(?You lead me)

They say that it is blind
But explain to me how blindness

Ended up being my blessing
Because your love struck me

Your blind love struck me
And shattered my window blind

Blinding my blindness with a light
That literally blinds me again

I guess mine is the case of
A blind leading a blind

And how you love me so
Giving me a life I never thought

Look what I
Ife to

See now I
I

That nothing can ever separate me
From the love of God

Not life, not death,
Not angels, not demons

Not my fears for today,
Or my worries for tomorrow

Nothing, nothing
Can ever separate me

From the love of God

Not the powers in the sky,
Or the ones on earth below

No demon in hell, nothing,
Nothing, absolutely nothing

Can ever separate me
From the love of God

That he showed in Christ Jesus,
My Lord. AMEN!

No one can Love me
Can love me, like that, No one can

No one can Love me
Can keep me, like that, No one can

No one can save me
Can keep me, like that, No one can

No one can protect me
Can love me, like that, No one can

Noo one can hold me
No one understands me, Like that

No one can
Unending Love

You gave me
Yo-ou gave me

You gave me
