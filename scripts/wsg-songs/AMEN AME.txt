Could only foretaste

Is now in our lifetime

You're rebuilding the ruined walls

You're reclaiming your design

You descend as fire to purify

You're reclaiming your words

You prune as the thistles and the thorns fall away

So we may produce good fruit

For the harvest is here

The Lord has said it

And he has done it

You have said it GOD

And you have done it
