PRAISES

Son of man,
Son of righteousness

King of the earth for sinners slain

I was lost in darkness bound

Ransomed my heart and I will sing

Blessed Jesus, we've come to give you praise

You are worthy,
and blessed be your name

We love you Lord...

You reign and you rule overall

Unto you we ascribe all our praise

You reign Lord
(You reign)

I will...

Bless the Lord,
Oh my soul

And all that is within me

Bless His Holy name
