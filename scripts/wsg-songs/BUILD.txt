MINISTERING
BUILD A HOUSE

With my hands I build a house

With my heart I let Him in

With my praise I build a house

With my worship I let him in

Cos when I lift my hands up I see

Nothing can intimidate you or me

Who the son set free is free indeed

The heart of a worshipper

Is a heart that will give you praise

When I lift my hands up it appears

My worries dissipate with all my fears

I reverence you inside my life...oh

The heart of a worshipper

Is a heart that will give you praise

When I lift my hands up I bow

My harvest I receive Oh Lord right now

Unto thee I made my vow

The heart of a worshipper

Is a heart  that will give you praise

When I lift my hands up I know

As a worshipper am never alone

You'll be with me wherever I go

The heart of a worshipper

The heart of a worshipper

Is a heart that will give you praise

With my praise I build a house

With my worship I let him in

Halleluyah,
that's what my song will be
