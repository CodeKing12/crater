In humble adoration we bow before your throne

As we come before your presence we honour you alone

So we lift up our voices as trumpets heralding you

You are the king of glory so this is what we do

We Worship You Today

cus you are Chirst our Lord

worship you chirst our Lord

The same God thats in me

the same one that spoke the word

He said let there be and there was

His words formed the universe

he created me

just like him

im. his light and his glory

he created me

to reign as him

its the same anointing i know

worked in ages

and it still works today

tag
You poured yourself out to me

tag
yes you come and bridged the gap

No longer searching for you

im the light that points to you
