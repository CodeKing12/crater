Chorus 1
Thank You Lord for saving my soul
Thank You Lord for making me whole
Thank You Lord for giving to me
Thy great salvation so rich and free

Verse 1
Some thank the Lord for friends and home
For mercies sure and sweet
But I would praise Him for His grace
In prayer I would repeat

Verse 2
Some thank Him for the flow'rs that grow
Some for the stars that shine
My heart is filled with joy and praise
Because I know He's mine

Verse 3
I trust in Him from day to day
I prove His saving grace
I'll sing this song of praise to Him
Until I see His face
