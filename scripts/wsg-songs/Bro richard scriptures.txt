I heard a sound from heaven, like the roar of rushing waters,

like a loud pillar of thunder.

The sound I heard was like that of harpers playing their harps.

And they sang a new song before the throne,

and before the four living creatures and the elders.

You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals,

because you were slain,

with your blood you purchased men for God.

From every tribe and language and people and nation.

You have made them to be a Kingdom of priests to serve our God,

and they will reign on the earth.

Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels,

numbering thousands of thousands,

and ten thousand times ten thousand.

They encircled the throne and the living creatures and the elders.

In a loud voice they sang, worthy is the lamb who was slain,

to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength

and honour and glory and blessing
