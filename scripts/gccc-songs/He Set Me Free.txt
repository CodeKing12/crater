Chorus 1
He set me free
Yes He set me free
And He broke the bonds
Of prison for me
I'm glory bound
My Jesus to see
For glory to God
He set me free

Verse 1
Once like a bird
In prison I dwelt
No freedom
From my sorrow I felt
But Jesus came
And listened to me
And glory to God
He set me free

Verse 2
Now I am climbing
Higher each day
Darkness of night
Has drifted away
My feet are planted
On higher ground
And glory to God
I'm homeward bound

Verse 3
Good-bye to sin
And things that confound
Naught of the world
Shall turn me around
Daily I'm working
I'm praying too
And glory to God
I'm going thru
