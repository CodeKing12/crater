This is My Private

My Private

You are my day, you are my night

You are my choice, you are my dream

You are my light, you are my hope

I will always listen for your voice

My every dream I will fulfill

Which brings me joy on every side

And all nations shall call me blessed

This is My Private Prayer

My Private

This is My Private

This is My Declaration

This is My Melody

I am elevated by your throne

You are the grace in every prayer

You give me the spirit of truth

So I could still be in the brand

Praises, glory, honour to your name

You Guided me in all my plans

Established in your will for me

And all nations shall call me blessed

I am elevated by your throne
