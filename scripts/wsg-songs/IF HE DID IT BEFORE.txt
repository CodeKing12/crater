MINISTERING
IF HE DID IT BEFORE
(SAME GOD)

I won't give in, no I'm not gonna turn around

I know I'll win, if I don't give up now

I am waiting for my change to come in I know

He has come through, this is how I'm so sure

If he did it before, he'd do it again

Same God right now, same God back then

If he did it before, he'd do it again

Same God right now, same God back then

(I've got power)
I've got power, I know I have overcome

Greater is in me, the fight ain't fair cause I've already won

I know I can't fall, I'll rise on higher than before

I'll keep on going up, this is how I'm so sure

If he did it before, he'd do it again

Same God right now, same God back then

If he did it before, he'd do it again,

Same God right now, same God back then

Please be encouraged, this is not the first storm you've been through

You've been through worse, you didn't come this far just to lose

He knows your needs, so take no thoughts of what you want

God will rain, and this is how I'm sure

If he did it before, he will do it again

Same God right now, same God back then

If he did it before, he will do it again

Same God right now

He is same God right now

He is, He is same God right now

He is, same God right now

If He did it before, He will do it again

Same God right now, same God back then

If He did it before, He will do it again

Please be encouraged, this is not the first storm you've been through

You've been through worse, you didn't come this far just to lose

He knows your needs, so take no thoughts of what you want

God will rain...
