You are making new wine

You are breaking new ground

So I yield to You and to Your careful hand

In the crushing, in the pressing

You are making new wine

In the soil I, now surrender

You are breaking new ground

So I yield to You and to Your careful hand

When I'm one with You, I don't need to understand

Make me Your vessel, make me an offering

Make me whatever You want me to be

I came here with nothing but all You have given me

Jesus, bring new wine out of me
