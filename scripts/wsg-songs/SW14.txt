PRAISE TEAM

God will make a way

Where there seems to be no way

He works in way we cannot see

He we make a way for me

He will be my guide

Hold me closely to his side

With love and strength

For each new day

He will make a way



Jehovah idi ebube

Eligwe ibu eze

Eluwa oya chichi

Eligwe ibu eze naja

Jehovah idi ebube

I will bless the lord
