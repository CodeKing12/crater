GOD PERSON

VERSE 1
I am one with the Lord

I'm his child I'm his own

I walk in His plans for me

Step by step
Leading me

To greater places
Greater heights

To rule and reign on the earth

CHORUS
I know God is in me

I see God in me

I'm perfected in his plan

I am God person

VERSE 2
All my being is just as you

I live on earth as God and King

I walk in His plans for me

Every moment every time

Making me who I ought to be

Dominating

Subduing

CHORUS
I know God is in me

I see God in me

I'm perfected in his plan

I am God person

I love the presence of the most high

He lives in me He lives in me

His Holy Word resides in me

Teaching me making me

I know God is in me

I see God in me

I'm perfected in His plan

I am God person
