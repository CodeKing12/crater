You are jesus and you

Come preparing us your temple

We were as a living stone

When you

And as you rose
from death in power

Come rise within our worship

Rise upon our praise

And let the hands that saw you raised

Clothe us in your glory

Draw us by your grace


Oh the glory of Your presence
We Your temple

Give You reverence
so rise from Your rest

And be blessed by our praise
As we glory in Your embrace

As Your presence
Now fills this place
