WORD SANCTUARY CHOIR
MINISTERING
I WILL REJOICE

I will rejoice

There
Make glad the city of our God

So I will rejoice I will rejoice
And be glad

(My depressed day

I will, I
Am gonna be glad

There

Full of grace, that flows
From Emmanuel


See i know
And he healed me,

he came and refreshed me

He came and washed my sins away

I will rejoice I will rejoice and be glad

I will rejoice I will rejoice and be glad

There

Full of grace, that flows
From Emmanuels vein

As anybody been cleansed from this fountain

That flows from Emmanuel

See I know for myself

And he healed me, he came and refresh me

He came and wash my sins away

Rejoice in the Lord always
And again I say

I will rejoice I will rejoice and be glad

I will rejoice I will rejoice and be glad
