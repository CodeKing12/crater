O Lord our God, How excellent Your name is

How excellent Your name in all the earth

Your glory fills the heavens, Beyond the furthest star

How excellent Your name in all the earth

O Lord our God, How excellent Your name is

How excellent Your name in all the earth

Your glory fills the heavens, Beyond the furthest star

How excellent Your name in all the earth

When I think about the heavens, The moon and the stars

I wonder what You ever saw in me

But You took me and You loved me, And You've given me a crown

And now I praise Your name eternally

O Lord our God, How excellent Your name is

How excellent Your name in all the earth

Your glory fills the heavens, Beyond the furthest star

How excellent Your name in all the earth

O Lord our God, How excellent Your name is

How excellent Your name in all the earth

Your glory fills the heavens, Beyond the furthest star

How excellent Your name in all the earth
