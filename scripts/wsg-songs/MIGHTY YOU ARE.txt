MIGHTY YOU ARE

LORD GOD almighty

You are clothed with majesty

The heavens declare your wonders

For you are great and do marvelous things

For you alone are God

There is no one else like you

Let the nations declare that you have done great things

Mighty you are,
Holy you are

Your mercy endureth forever more

Righteous you are,
Great you are

I will exalt you oh Lord,
My God my King

For you alone are God

There is no one else like you

Let the nations declare that you have
Done great things

Oh oh oh  oh oh oh oh
