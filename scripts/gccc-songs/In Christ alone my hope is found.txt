In Christ alone my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my
This cornerstone, this solid
Firm through the fiercest

What heights of love, what
When fears are stilled, when
My comforter, my all in all
Here in the love of Christ I stand

In Christ alone who took on
Fullness of God in helpless
This gift of love and
Scorned by the ones He came

Till on that cross as Jesus
The wrath of God was
For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I

There in the ground His body
Light of the world by darkness
Then bursting forth in
Up from the grave He rose

And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on
For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious

No guilt in life, no fear in
This is the power of Christ in
From life's first cry to final
Jesus commands my destiny

No power of hell, no scheme
Can ever pluck me from His
Till He returns or calls me
Here in the power of Christ I'll
stand
