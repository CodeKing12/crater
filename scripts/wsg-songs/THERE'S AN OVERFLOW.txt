There

It

There

I've taken over, i've taken over

Walking in abundance

Moving with the speed of the Holy Ghost

We are favoured

It's a new level

The glory of the latter

Is greater than the former
(The blessing is here, all here)

It's beyond my wildest dreams
What the Lord is doing

(It's our reality, our reality)

We've taken over

Oh oh oh....
It's a new level

The glory of the latter

Is greater than the former
(The blessing is here, all here)

It's beyond my wildest dreams

What the Lord is doing
(It's our reality, our reality)
