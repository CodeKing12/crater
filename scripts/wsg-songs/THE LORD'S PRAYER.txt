Our Father

which art in heaven

Hallowed be, hallowed be thy name

Thy kingdom come

Thy will be done

On earth, as it is in heaven

Give us this day our daily flight

And forgive us our debts

As we forgive our debtors

Ah ah ah ah ah ah

And lead us not into temptation

but deliver us from evil

For thine is the kingdom

and the power

and the glory

for ever

Forever and ever

Forever and ever Amen

For thine is the kingdom

and the power

And the glory, forever

Forever and ever

Forever and ever

Amen
