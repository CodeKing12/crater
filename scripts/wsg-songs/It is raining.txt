Wet, Wet, Wet, How you feel? Tell me how you feel!

Oh, it's raining, all around me, I can feel it, it's a latter rain

Ride on Jesus, please send more rain, Until we are wet,

until we are soaked, In the latter rain

It's raining, all around me, I can feel it, it's a latter rain

Ride on Jesus, please send more rain, Until we are wet,

until we are soaked, In the latter rain

It's raining, come on! Oh, i's raining, all around me

I can feel it, it's a latter rain

Ride on Jesus, please send more rain, Until we are wet, until we are soaked

Wet, wet, wet - soaked, soaked soaked
