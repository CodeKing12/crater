VERSE
Father

Oh what a love you have lavished

On me a mortal to be called yours

To share your image divine

What an honor

To be ordained and anointed

To be your man and your scepter

Dancing the rhythm of your heart

VERSE
Forever God

Your glory God

Is all I'm living for

Without you God

There

Forever I

VERSE
Let every fiber of my being

Bring you the worship you deserve

Let every story of my life

Bring you the worship you deserve

I love the rhythm of your heart

The rhythm of your heart

Ohhhh

Let every fiber

Bring you the worship

Let every story

Bring you the worship

Dancing the rhythm of your heart
