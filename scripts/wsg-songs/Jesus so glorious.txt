Jesus all glorious
Create In us a temple
Called as living stones
Where You're enthroned
As You rose from death in power
So rise within our Worship
Rise upon our Praise
And let the hand that saw you raised
Clothe us in Your Glory
Draw us by Your Grace

Oh the glory of your presence
We your temple
Give you reverence
So arise to your rest
And be blessed by our praise
As we glory in your embrace
As your presence now fill this place
