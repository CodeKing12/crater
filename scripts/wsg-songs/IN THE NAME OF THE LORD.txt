MINISTERING
IN THE NAME OF THE LORD

verse1
Crowds have lined the narrow street

To see this man from Galilee

He's Just a carpenter some say,

and he's leading fools astray

Yet many kneel to give him praise

And in his eyes, they glimpse the power

That sees the hearts of all men

And he knows his father

He speaks his father

For he comes in the name of the lord

Chorus
and there is strength in the name of the lord

There is power in the name of the Lord

There is hope in the name of the lord

Blessed is He, who comes in the name of the Lord

verse2
and When my plans have fallen through

And when my strength is nearly gone

and When there

And the power of your name

And as we call upon your name

Your strength through weakness to show

We can know the master's plan
we can extend the master's hand

When we come in the name of the Lord

Chorus
There is strength in the name of the lord

There is power in the name of the Lord

There is hope in the name of the lord

Blessed is He, who comes in the name of the Lord

Bridge
His name will be worshiped forever

as creator, my redeemer and king

Chorus
There is strength in the name of the lord

There is power in the name of the Lord

There is hope in the name of the lord

Blessed is He, who comes
Blessed is He, who comes
Blessed is He, who comes

in the name of the Lord

In the name of the lord
In the name of the lord
