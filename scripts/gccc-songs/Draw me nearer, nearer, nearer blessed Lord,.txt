I am Thine, O Lord, I have
And it told Thy love to me;
But I long to rise in the arms
And be closer drawn to Thee.

Draw me nearer, nearer
To the cross where Thou hast

Draw me nearer, nearer,
To Thy precious, bleeding

By the pow'r of grace divine;
Let my soul look up with a
And my will be lost in Thine.
That before Thy throne I

When I kneel in prayer, and
I commune as friend with
Till I cross the narrow sea;
There are heights of joy that I

Till I rest in peace with Thee.
Draw me nearer, nearer
To the cross where Thou hast

Draw me nearer, nearer,
To Thy precious, bleeding
side.
