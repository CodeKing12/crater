I'm a lover of your presence
And it's all i wanna be

I'm a lover of your presence
that's where i wanna be


Let this be a sacrifice
let me dedicate my life to worship
Oh lord

a passion stirring deep inside
you're all that really satisfies
i worship you
Oh Lord

a passion stirring deep inside
you're all that really satisfies
we worship you
Oh Lord

I was made for Love
I was made for loving you
