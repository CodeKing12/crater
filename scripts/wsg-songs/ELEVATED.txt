I was shattered, broken and dead
You came, you raised and elevated me

When I was lost and left in the dark
You came, you raised and elevated me

Down cast and faced with trials
You came, you raised and elevated me

Yes, you showed up with light
And gave me answers

Now I can sing
Now I can shout

Now I can scream my heart to you
