Verse

The Lord bless you, And keep you

Make His face shine upon you

And be gracious to you

The Lord turn His, Face toward you

And give you peace

Bridge

Amen, amen, amen

Chorus

May His favor be upon you

And a thousand generations

And Your family and your children

And their children, and their children

May His presence go before you

And behind you, and beside you

All around you, and within you

He is with you, He is with you

In the morning, in the evening

In your coming, and your going

In your weeping, and rejoicing

He is for you, He is for you

Bridge

Amen, amen, amen

Chorus
May His presence go before you

And behind you, and beside you

All around you, and within you

He is with you, He is with you

In the morning, in the evening

In your coming, and your going

In your weeping, and rejoicing

He is for you

Verse
The Lord bless you, And keep you

Make His face shine upon you

The Lord turn His, Face toward you

And give you peace

May he give you peace.
