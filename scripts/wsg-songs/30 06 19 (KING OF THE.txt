BRIDGE

In the midnight hour

I was searching for the power

'Cause I needed my mountain

Crushed into bit and powder

Like a balm you took away my pain

Picked up when I called your name

I was way way down in shame

'Cause of You Lord

I won before I started the game



It's because of you

It's because of you

Jesu!

Because of you

Ah Ah I live my live brand new


Adonai Adonai Adonai.....

Adonai Adonai Adonai.....

We call You Adonai

Adonai Adonai Adonai.....

Adonai Adonai Adonai.....
