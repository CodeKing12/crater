Give me bread and give me wine
And I'll be forever satisfied
You have called me to your table
and I'll dine

I have bread and I have wine
And i am forever satisfied
You have called me to your table
and I'll dine

Here I come Before your table, before your throne Here I come Full of hunger and thirst

Here I am Before your table, before your throne Here I am Full of hunger and thirst

Lord I come Before your table, before your throne Lord I come Full of hunger and thirst

Who else has the word of Life?
Who else shall we follow?
Who else can bring back to life?
You are the bread of life

this is where i belong
sitting at your feet
this is where i belong gazing to your heart

hmmmm.....
