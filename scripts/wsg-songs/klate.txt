SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

In one place

In one tabernacle with Jesus...

There is no other place

Where I'd rather be

In one place

In one tabernacle with him

I'm here because I wanna be

I'm here because I choose to be

I'm here because I love to be

In your presence

I find peace here

I find  Joy here

All I need is here

In your presence

I won't seek

I won't search

I won't chase

Cos I've  found you, In my heart

Cos I've  found you, In my heart ...
