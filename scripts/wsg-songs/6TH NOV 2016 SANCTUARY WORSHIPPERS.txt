Looked around and suddenly realised

That you've been so good to me

Your mercy is everlasting,
Undenying, Overwhelming

Who am I that you're mindful of

Who am I that you pick my calls when I call on you

Who am I that you're so mindful of

Who am I that you hear my cry

The source of my strength,
Na you

The strength of my life,
Na you

My hope and My joy,
Na you

You are my confidence,
Na you

We exalt you
oh God...

Oh oh oh oh oh

Oh Lord
