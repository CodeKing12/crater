SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

As we enter in to worship you

You
We honour you

No one

You are higher than all


Consume us with your presence

Lord seeing your face

Is what our heart desire

Surround us with your love and grace

Let your train fill this holy place


We long for your glory

Please send down your glory

How we need your glory

Let it be revealed


We need fresh oil

We need it to drench us from above

Nothing else matters

Please let your glory cover us

Oh oh oh..........
