cos i move mountains

every time i pray

all things go my way

that minute i pray

it is my advantage

every time i pray

your goodness comes my way

no breaks no delay

EKALABEN

When the price of greatness comes knocking

EVASISTEN

When the costs appear more than you can pay

EKALABET

For this reason, Jesus paved my way

NEVASISTEN

No resistance, my sacrifice is all the way

RO SHAMA

God, my Shepherd
