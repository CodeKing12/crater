Chorus 1
In Your presence there is comfort
In Your presence there is peace
When we seek to know Your heart
We will find such blessed assurance
In Your holy presence Lord

Verse 1
In the quiet of this hour
As I kneel before You now
I believe Your promise to be faithful
I don't always understand
What Your perfect will demands
But I've learned to trust You more
In Your presence Lord

Verse 2
There can be such sweet reward
When we wait upon the Lord
As we take the time
He gives His perfect wisdom
To be found in Him alone
All our deepest secrets known
We're surrounded by His grace
When we seek His face

ENDING
In Your presence there is comfort
In Your presence there is peace
When we seek the Father's heart
We will find such blessed assurance
An ever-open door
To know our Savior more
In the presence of our Lord
