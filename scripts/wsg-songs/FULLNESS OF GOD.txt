I have no limitation

I live God's expectations

Everything is working for me

Nothing is hard for me

I have the life of God burning in me

There is no limit to what I can do

I have no limitation

Nothing is hard for me

He's right here working in me

Nothing is hard for him

I am in the fullness of God

I am complete in him

I have no limitation

I live God's expectations

Everything is working for me

Nothing is hard for me

I'm in you

Oh oh I'm in you

I have no limitation

I live God's expectations

Everything is working for me

Nothing is hard for me

We're in you

Oh we're in you

We are in the fullness of God

We are complete in him
