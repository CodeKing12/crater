Mountains are still being moved
Strongholds are still being loosed
God we believe, 'cause yes we can see it
That wonders are still what You do

And bodies are still being raised
Giants are still being slain
God we believe, yes we can see it
That wonders are still what You do

We are here for You, come and do what You do
We are here for You, come and do what You do
We set our hearts on You, come and do what You do
'Cause we need a move
We need a move

We need a move
We need a move

We need a move yeah
We need a move
