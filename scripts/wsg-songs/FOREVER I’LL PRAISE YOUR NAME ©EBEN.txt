JESUS YOU ARE MY SAVIOUR
YOU ARE ALL I EVER WANTED

FOREVER I WILL SHOUT YOUR NAME
FOREVER I WILL SING YOUR PRAISE

TO YOU BE THE GLORY
TO  YOU BE THE HONOUR

FOREVER I WILL PRAISE YOUR NAME OH GOD
FOREVER I WILL WORSHIP YOU OH GOD

WHO MADE THE SUN TO SHINE
AND THE RAIN TO FALL

WHO MADE A WAY FOR U
AND A WAY FOR ME
