MINISTERING
SO GOOD

In the morning when I rise I'll praise your name

At the end of each day I'll lift my praise to you

You deliver me from all my pain

You've given to me a brand new day

You're the melody in my heart
(ah ah)

The giver of every song
(ah ah)

You're the lifter of my head
(ah ah)

You're the glory upon my life

Jesus.. Jesus you're so good

Once I was lost but now am found am found in you

Once I was blind but now I see a brand new day

You took my shame you took my pain and gave

Your name

Am not the man I used to be am a new creation

You're my praise in the morning
(ah ah)

You're my song in the night (ah ah)

You're the lifter that f my head
(ah ah)

You're the glory upon my life

Jesus.. Jesus you're so good...

How you changed my life eternally

You gave my life a meaning....
