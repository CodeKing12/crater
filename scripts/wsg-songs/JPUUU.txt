THE SOLID ROCK

Chorus 1
On Christ the solid Rock I stand,
All other ground is sinking sand.
All other ground is sinking sand.

Verse 1
My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness.
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly lean on Jesus' name.

Verse 2
When darkness seems to hide His face,
I rest on His unchanging grace.
In every high and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within the veil.

Verse 3
His oath, His covenant, His blood,
Support me in the whelming flood.
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my Hope and Stay.

Verse 4
When He shall come with trumpet sound,
O may I then in Him be found!
Dressed in His righteousness alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne!

LORD I BELIEVE

Lord I believe
Lord I believe

All things are possible

Lord I believe

Lord I receive
Lord I receive

All things are possible

Lord I receive
