i am glad
My heart is calm
You are my peace
I can't be moved
like zion's hill
My feet are still

You are my God
You are my God
You are my God (x2

You are my Peace
You are my Peace
You are my Peace (x2)

No other Lord
No lord
But You

My lover is Jesus
it's Jesus
it's Jesus

My Saviour is Jesus
it's Jesus
it's Jesus

My redeemer is Jesus
it's Jesus
it's Jesus

it's Jesus
it's Jesus
it's Jesus


You are my joy
You are my joy
You are my joy (x2

No other King
No King
But You

you are my Judge

i look to the storm
cause you are my Peace

I will not be moved
I will not be moved
