I am a worshipper
I worship in spirit and truth

I raise the alarm
That Jesus is Lord forever

In his name men are saved
His blood cleans us from all our sins

Now we're new in Christ our King
He reigns

Jesus Reigns forever more

My Jesus Reigns forever more

He reigns

He reigns forever

Jesus Reigns

I won't stop

Till the whole world
Proclaim him Lord

And believe in the son
That Jesus Christ is our King

Jesus Reigns forever more

My Jesus Reigns forever more

He reigns
