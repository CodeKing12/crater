THOU ART WORTHY

We say thou art Worthy

Thou art Worthy

We say thou art Worthy O Lord

We the heavens declare,

All the brightness of your Glory,

We say thou art Worthy O Lord.

For all the Victories we've received,

Thou art Worthy

For all the Salvations we've received,

We say that thou art Worthy.

Cause we lifted our voice,

And we cried and you heard us from heaven.

We say thou art Worthy O Lord.

And We declare our God is Good.

His goodness and his mercies endureth.

Cause we lifted our voice

and we cried and you heard us from Heaven,

We say thou art Worthy O Lord.

For Thou art so great,

Your Glory fills the heavens,

For Thou art so great,

Your brightness fills the heavens,

For Thou art so great,

Your Glory fills the heavens,

For Thou art so great,

Creation can't express or define who you are.

You are ageless, timeless,

Unending God,

Unending God.

You are ageless, timeless,

Eternal God,

Eternal God.
