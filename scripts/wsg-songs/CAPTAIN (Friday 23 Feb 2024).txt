WSC MINISTERING
CAPTAIN OF ISRAEL'S HOST

Captain of Israel's host, and guide

For all who seek the land above,

Beneath thy shadow we abide,

The cloud of thy protecting love;

Our strength, thy grace; our rule, thy word;

Our end, the glory of the Lord.

By thine unerring Spirit led,

We shall not in the desert stray;

We shall not full direction need,

Nor miss our providential way;

As far from danger as from fear,

While love, almighty love, is near
