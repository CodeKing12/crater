VERSE1
Oh Lord my God

You are my king and I bow my knees

In reverence Lord for you I live

All that I am, all I have

is for your glory

is for your grace

CHORUS
The heavens tremble,

Mountains skip and walls fall

In your presence

You are God alone

I lift my hands, I lift my all to you

I lift my voice to say

I am yours

VERSE2
Lord there's none beside thee

You are El-Elyon

The Lord most high

I bow to you

We adore your name
