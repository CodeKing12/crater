My hope is built on nothing less

Verse
My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus

No merit of my own I claim
But wholly lean on Jesus

On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
All other ground is sinking sand.

Verse
When darkness veils his lovely face,
I rest on his unchanging grace;

In every high and story gale
My anchor holds within the veil.

On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
All other ground is sinking sand.

Verse
His oath, his covenant, his blood
Sustain me in the raging flood;

When all supports are washed away,
He then is all my hope and stay.

On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
All other ground is sinking sand.

Verse
When he shall come with trumpet sound,
Oh, may I then in him be found,

Clothed in his righteousness alone,
Redeemed to stand before the throne!

On Christ, the solid rock, I stand;
All other ground is sinking sand.
