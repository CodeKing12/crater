I stand before You now
The greatness of your renown
I have heard of the majesty and
King of Heaven, in humility, I bow

As Your love, in wave after wave
Crashes over me, crashes over me
For You are for us
You are not against us
Champion of Heaven
You made a way for all to enter
To Your love, in wave after wave
Crashes over me, crashes over me
For You are for us
You are not against us
Champion of Heaven
You made a way for all to enter in

I have heard You calling my name
I have heard the song of love that You
So I will let You draw me out beyond
Into Your grace
Your grace

Cause You make me brave
You make me brave
You call me out beyond the shore into
You make me brave
You make me brave
No fear can hinder now the love that

You make me brave
You make me brave
You call me out beyond the shore into
Cause You make me brave
You make me brave
No fear can hinder now the promises


Because Your love, in wave after wave
Crashes over me, crashes over me
For You are for us
You are not against us
Champion of Heaven
You made a way...
Because Your love, in wave after wave
Crashes over me, crashes over me
For You are for us
You are not against us
Champion of Heaven
You made a way
Champion of Heaven
You made a way for all to enter in
