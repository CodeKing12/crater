My soul longs for You
My soul longs for You
Nothing else will do
Nothing else will do

I believe You will come like
I believe You will come like
And I believe You will
I believe You will come like

Oh, I believe, I believe
I see the cloud and oh,
And oh, the rain is
Oh, revival, revival rain
Oh, I see the clouds
It's coming, coming, it's
coming
