If not for you who would have saved my life

If not for you Jehovah

If not for you Omega Onyewem agam n'ekele gi

More than my mouth can testify

More than my mind can comprehend

I've seen the wonders of your grace and

I'm so sure that this is not the end

Oh oh oh oh oh Eze Ebube

See how far you've  brought me

Eze Ebube

I'm so glad you found me worthy

I can see I can tell and I know

it's your grace all my days

I will sing your praise
