MINISTERING
EMPTY ME

VERSE
Want to be more like you I want to live just for you

How can I get to this place when I'm broken and shattered

My life is filled with worries unforgiveness lies within

I'm ready to come out of this

How can I get there

CHORUS
So I say empty me Lord,

Take out everything not like you

Everything in my life not pleasing you

Please take it away so I can be all yours, all yours

Empty me

bridge
Empty me Lord

Give me more of You

I want more of You Lord

Only You can satisfy

I want more of You Lord

Only You can satisfy

I want more of You Lord

Only You can satisfy

Only You can Satisfy...

So I say empty me Lord,

Take out everything not like you

Everything in my life not pleasing you

Please take it away so I can be all yours, all yours
