FINALLY FOUND

We've been together for so long now

But I don't think I can go on like this

Everytime I try to break out

You're always there parading my regrets

I remember when he told me

That it could never get better than this

Turns out the truth is that you sold me

This fake identity

Something's gotta give
This is no way to live

I'm not who I was
I'm not what I've done

Love changed everything

What I've been searching for

Has finally found me

From the beginning up until now

You fought to be the voice inside my head

You controlled me

'Til I found out my true identity

I've got so much to give

A better life to live now

I'm not who I was
I'm not what I've done

Love changed everything

What I've been searching for

Has finally found me

So long
Goodbye

No more you and I

What we had then is through

I see my future now without you

Old ways are done

Breaking up with the old me now

Breaking up with the old me now

It's over

I'm not who I was
I'm not what I've done

Love changed everything

What I've been searching for

Has finally found me
