MINISTERING
O PRAISE YE THE LORD

O praise ye the Lord!
Praise Him in the height
Rejoice in his word
Ye angels of the light
Ye heavens adore him
By whom ye were made
And worship before him
In the brightness arrayed.

O praise ye the Lord!
Praise him upon earth
In tuneful accord
Ye sons of new birth
Praise him who hath brought you
His grace from above
Praise him who hath taught you
To sing of his love.

O praise ye the Lord!
All things that give sound
Each jubilant chord
Re-echo around;
Loud organs his glory
Forth tell in deep tone,
and sweet harp, the story
Of what he hath done.

O praise ye the Lord!
Thanksgiving and song
To him be out-poured
All ages along
For love in creation
For heaven restored
For grace of salvation
O praise ye the Lord!
