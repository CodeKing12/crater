HOLY GHOST BREED

light of the world
You stepped down into darkness.

Opened my eyes let me see.

Beauty that made this heart adore you

Hope of a life spent with you

chorus
Here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down,

Here I am to say that You're my God

You're altogether lovely

Altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

Lord, I give you my heart
I give you my soul

I live for you alone

Every breath I take
Every moment I'm awake

Lord, have Your way in me

My heart my mind my soul belongs to you

My love my life it all belongs to you

Belongs to you
oh yeah

Belongs to you

chorus
Yeah I surrender it all

Yes I turn it all over

Yes it all belongs to you

I just wanna love you more and more

How I long to be deeper in........ love

I was lost when you found me

You pulled me close and held me near

And I'm a fool but still you love

I'll be your fool for the king of love

He gave me wings so I could fly

And gave me a song to color the sky

And all I have is all from you

And all I want is all of you

chorus
It's grace, grace

I'm nothing without you

Grace, your grace
shines on me

shines on me
shines on me

I'm everything with you

shines on me
shines on me

Its your grace

shines on me

Your grace

oh

Your grace it shines on me

Your grace
Your grace

shines on me
shines on me

Your grace it shines on me

Your grace
