Lord, Your sheer mercy

Flows to all

Slow to anger

Abounding in love

Not for earthly glory

But for Your praise

You created a masterpiece

You created me

Your love is ever sure

And in its steadfastness

It has no end

The glory of Your reign

And the greatness of Your name

It has no end

CHORUS
Great God of love

I know Your faithfulness

It has no end

I'll love You every day with this very life You gave

It has no end

VERSE
In all the stories told and heard

None describes the depth of Your love

Even up till date, none has puzzled out the vastness of space

All those who have waited

Just to see Your end (Oh Lord God)

You still loved them to their very end

Your love is ever sure

And in its steadfastness

It has no end

The glory of Your reign

And the greatness of Your name

It has no end

CHORUS
Great God of love

I know Your faithfulness

It has no end

I'll love You every day with this very life You gave

It has no end

TAG
There is no other

There's no love like yours

Hallelujah I have seen your love

It has no end

There is no other

There is no love like yours

Hallelujah I have seen your love

It has no end

Your love is ever sure

And in its steadfastness

It has no end

The glory of Your reign

And the greatness of Your name

It has no end
