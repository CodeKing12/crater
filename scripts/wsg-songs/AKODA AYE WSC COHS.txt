The heaven is your Throne

And the earth is your footstool

Every creature sings of your wonder

What a mighty God you are

The hills are lambs before you

And the mountains skip like rams

Everytime you speak, we are in awe
What a mighty God you are

Akoda Aye

We can't use just words
to describe everything you are

Olori Aye

He who was and is and is to come.

Kabiyesi oh
Akoda Aye

We can't use just words to
describe everything you are

Oloriaye
You who was and is and is to come

You are unending
Oh oh.

You spoke and everything came to be
Your authority none can defy

Awesome splendour, Your Royal Majesty
What a mighty God you are.

Ruler of our hearts
Owner of our will

Master of all
You're the One we adore

You own everything.

You are bigger and you are greater

And there is nothing that is beyond you.

Everything created was in you,
by you and for you

You are superior.
There is nothing that is too large for you,

Aterere kariaye
Akoda Aye

We can't use just words
to describe everything you are

Olori Aye

He who was and is and is to come.

Kabiyesi oh
Akoda Aye

We can't use just words to
describe everything you are

Oloriaye
You who was and is and is to come

You are unending
Oh oh.
