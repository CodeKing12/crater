Mh...

Master the tempest is raging

The sails of my ship are tattered and torn

The rocks that surround me have broken my bow

And my helm is of no use; I can

This way and that way I

And the way things look now this night should be my last

But I know better and I won

Cause I know you are near

I do see Jesus

He

He rules over everything

Jesus

He overcame the sting of death

Freed me from the power of sin

Jesus

There

One call changes everything

Oh Jesus

I feel You, I trust You

You reign

Oh Jesus

They say this match up is rough

My opponent has the reach advantage, build and experience

Yes I agree, He is tough

He has his strategy and his team, legions and legions

But I know I

Because there

I know I walk in victory

All enemies are defeated

I see Jesus

He

He rules over everything

Jesus

He overcame the sting of death

Freed me from the power of sin

Jesus

There

One call changes everything

Oh oh Jesus

I feel You, I trust You

You reign

Oh oh oh

Darkness and light are subject to Him

The wind and the waves respond to his voice

He rules and reigns over everything

So I

The Captain is near

If our God is for us then no one can be against us

His name is our battle cry

Greater is He that

The power and the glory is Thine

I do see Jesus

He

He rules over everything

Jesus

He overcame the sting of death

Freed me from the power of sin

Jesus

There

One call changes everything

Oh Jesus

I feel You, I trust You

You reign

Oh Jesus

Ohhhhh Jesus

Oh Jesus

There is power in the name of Jesus to break every chain,

to break every chain
