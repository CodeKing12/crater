This live that I Live

Is all Yours

I move and have my being

All in You

I'm aligned to your Will

Not mine, but your's be done

Jesus, as in Heaven

So on Earth

This Song that I bring

Is all Yours

Take my heart, take all of me

If you're looking for a man

If you're looking for a vessel

I say yes, amen, I say yes

My Song is yes, yes, yes, Lord

In your Sufficiency

Yes, Yes, Lord

If you're looking for a man

If you're looking for a vessel

I say yes, amen, I say yes

This air that I Breathe

Is all Yours

Concencrated unto thee

If you need a Man to Pray

Here I am, Lord

I say yes, amen, I say yes

This hands that I lift

Is all Yours

Take the glory, father

Take the praise

If you're looking for just one man

If you're looking for a vessel

I say yes, amen, I say yes

My Song is yes

Yes, Yes, Lord

In your sufficiency

Yes, yes, Lord

If you're looking for a man

If you're looking for a vessel

I say yes, amen, I say yes

My Song is yes

Yes, yes, Lord

In your sufficiency

Yes, yes, Lord

If you're looking for a man

If you're looking for a vessel

I say yes, amen, I say yes

What is Life

If it's not lived for You, You, You, You

What is life

If I don't shout Your praise, Your, Your praise

What is life If I don't tell

You're coming soon

You're coming again

I say yes, amen, I say yes

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

I say yes, yes, amen
