Be the wind inside my
The anchor in the waves
Oh oh, He is my song
Let the King of my heart
Be the fire inside my
The echo of my days
Oh, He is my song

Let the King of my heart
Be the mountain where I
The fountain I drink from
Oh, He is my song
Let the King of my heart
Be the shadow where I
The ransom for my life
Oh, He is my song

Cause You are good
You are good, oh oh
You are good
You are good, oh oh

You are good, oh oh
You are good
You are good, oh oh

You're never gonna let
You're never gonna let
And You're never gonna
You're never gonna let
You're never gonna let
You're never gonna let
