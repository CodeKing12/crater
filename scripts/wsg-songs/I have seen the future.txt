I have seen the future

The glory of the Lord  is here

I can see the whole world

Worshipping the Lord

Jesus like a banner

Raised up in the sky

Every tongue and nation

Bowing to the King

Can you see it?

I can see it

Chorus
Ogo Ogo Ogo Ogo (Glory, glory, glory, glory)

Halle Hallelujah

Bridge
All the nations of the world will sing

Jesus is the Lord

All the nations of the world will sing

Halle Hallelujah

All the nations of the world will sing

Jesus is the Lord

All the nations of the world will sing

Halle Hallelujah
