BLESS YOUR NAME

From the darkness came the light

Out of nothingness you made light

For before the world You were

Bless Your name forevermore

Lord according to Your plan

You created every man

Just to glorify you and

Bless Your name forevermore

ooh ooh

Then into the world You came

By the power of Your name

And you washed my sins away

Bless Your name forevermore

So I come before Your throne

Through the goodness of my own

And I worship You alone

Bless Your name forevermore

I will bless Your name

I will bless Your name

I will bless Your name forevermore

I will bless Your name

I will bless Your name

I will bless Your name forevermore

Chorus
I will bless Your name

I will bless Your name

I will bless Your name forevermore

I will bless Your name

I will bless Your name

I will bless Your name forevermore...
