## Introduction
I got really tired of paid projection software so I built this Scripture Projection software with the aim of minimizing church costs and increasing efficiency. It's open-source so your church community can contribute to it or customize it as you see fit (as long as you abide by the very lenient licensing).

My goal with this software is to provide a free, more performant alternative to EasyWorship so your reviews are much needed to make this as optimal as the Church of God deserves.

## Downloading & Installing
Go to the [releases page for this repo](https://github.com/CodeKing12/crater/releases), download the latest release for your operating system and run the installer. That's all.

Love and Peace to you all by the Mercies of Our God.
