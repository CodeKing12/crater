verse 1
God of our fathers the strength of our people and nation
Gladly we come to thy presence with true adoration

Seeking thy face, trusting thy love and thy grace
Thou art our health and salvation

Verse 2
God of all mercy for pardon and peace we implore thee
Humbly proclaiming our wealth and our victories before thee

Children of men standing and standing always.
Still give us grace to adore thee

Verse 3
God of the poor and the weak to our prayer now attending
Teach us to follow the master of all men in blending

Worship with deed, praises with service to need
All men in His name befriending

Verse 4
God of all people, let justice and peace like a river
Flow through the world until  all in one  common endeavor

Build among men brotherhood
Thine be the glory forever
