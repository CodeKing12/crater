Open the Heavens, oh Lord

And pour out Your Spirit

Cover the earth with Your glory

Let the sound prepare the way

Kingdom come globally

As the waters cover the sea

Open the Heavens, oh Lord

Pour out Your Spirit

Cover the earth with Your glory

Cover the earth with Your glory

Cover the earth with the sound of Heaven

All of the earth is Yours

All of the nations adore You

Cover the earth with the sound of Heaven

Let a new sound be released

As the waters cover the sea

Cover the earth
