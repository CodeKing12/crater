Love is Patient
Love is kind
I kept waiting while the world
Finally you held my hand

And I
Can we do this forever
Even when we are grey
Hand in hand till our days are
Our story of love well told

You are my dream come true
Fruit of my patience
you are divine
The best gift a child could ask
You came to me just in time
You found me and now you

Lalalala
Lalala

Like grape fruits in a vineyard
A feast for the eyes but not for
Why did you take so long

My darling I promise I was
But Eli said beloved rest your
It wasn
But everything

Trust me I wanted it sooner
To make you mine and to
It could have been anyone but
You are my God
I

You are my beauty for ashes
And I am your glory for shame

Love had His perfect work
and now you are mine
And I am yours

Oooh
Oooh ooh oh
