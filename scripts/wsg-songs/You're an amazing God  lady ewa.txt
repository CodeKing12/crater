How blessed is our God

What a blessing he is

Father of our Master, Jesus the Christ

Takes us to the high places of blessings in Him

Long before he laid down earth's fountains

He had us in mind

Settled on us as the focus of His love

To be made whole and holy by His love

And be set apart, blameless in His sight

Long long ago

He decided to adopt is into His family

Through Jesus, the Christ

Oh what a pleasure he took in planning this

Reconciled us

And redeemed us

Circumcised us

And renewed us

Freed us

You received us

Cleansed us

And he set us apart

So we're separated for Him

Consecrated to Him

Meditated by Him

Dedicated to Him

Sanctified, justified, purified for Him

You're an amazing God

Everytime I think.. I think I think

You're an amazing God

Everytime I think I think I think

You're an amazing God

Every time...I THINK
