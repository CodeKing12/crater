A broken spirit is all that really matter

A contrite heart is everything to you

For our God is great

We lift our hands to him

That's what our God deserve

Our sacrifice

I give myself to you

Holy and acceptable

With my hands lifted high

My eyes is where you are

With my heart stayed on you

Oh oh oh
My reality is you

I am where you are

My heart on you

My life on you

My mind on you

Hallelujah to you
