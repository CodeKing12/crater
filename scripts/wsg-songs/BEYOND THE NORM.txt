MINISTERING
BEYOND THE NORM

I am the head, and not the tail

More than a conqueror,
that

I shall arise and I

For the Glory of the Lord

Beyond the norm
Beyond the world

Beyond the natural,
I will excel

I

By the power of the Lord!

Beyond the limits
Beyond the norm

Beyond the ordinary
We overcome!

If God be for us, who can stand against us?

We have the victory through Christ the Lord!

I am blessed and not cursed

Never broken, and I'm strong

Still alive, satisfied

I

Beyond the norm
Beyond the world

Beyond the natural,
I will excel

I

By the power of the Lord!

Beyond the limits
Beyond the norm

Beyond the ordinary
We overcome!

If God be for us
who can stand against us?

We have the victory through Christ the Lord!

Beyond the limits
Beyond the norm

Beyond the ordinary
We overcome!

If God be for us
Who can stand against us?

We have the victory through Christ the Lord!

Greater is He that is in me

Than he that is in the world

I can do, I can do all things

Beyond the norm...

Yeah!
(Yeah)

I

Higher and higher, higher and higher!

Yeah!
