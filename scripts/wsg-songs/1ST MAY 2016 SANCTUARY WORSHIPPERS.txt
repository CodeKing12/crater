SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

No other God can be called a father

No other God can be called a friend

No other God can be called redeemer

No other God is coming back again

How we love your name Jesus

You're the beautiful one, we love your name

How we love you, King of kings

How we love you, Lord of lords

We love the fragrance of your holy name

You came and brought us into the reign of grace

Glory to the righteous One
