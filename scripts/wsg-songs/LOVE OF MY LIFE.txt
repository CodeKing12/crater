Chorus
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my soul

Oh for your love that I breathe

You are the love of my life
You are the love of my soul

Oh for your love that I live
You are the love of my life

You are the love of my soul

Verse
Love love love

Love in all its cheesiness

They say its all that matters,Really?

The same love that can't seems to
hold people who claim to be in it together,

That love...
Full of lies, mischief, deceit, ignorance, lust

A tale told to mislead us.

Disney in all its glamour preaches an
unattainable love

Books, movies all their representation
of love, is full of fantasy

I've had my share of love you know
When I still believed in it's power of happiness

You wanna know what I found
At first you glow but later you drown, yes drown

Insecurities, pain, anguish, that's all you get

You start doubting your sanity,
doubting your ability to live.

Ladies let no man deceive you
Love is just a fairytale we were told

Which blinded us from seeing the
animalistic features of men

Men be warned not all you see is true

You'll find yourself regretting
the decisions you made initially

For every skirt has a secret under it;
And after all this,

you still want to experience that figment of imagination?

That obscure, untrue emotion that
leaves you fragile and vunerable to hurt and pain.

No I don't want to know love
Can't bear to stand close to those walls

Never again.

Chorus
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my soul

Oh for your love that I breathe

You are the love of my life
You are the love of my soul

Oh for your love that I live
You are the love of my life

You are the love of my soul

Verse
Love?
You ask what Love is

Love is not an emotion
He is not just a fleeting feeling

Love, true Love
Came into the earth years ago

He gave up his life
To save

For you and for me
To take our sins away

To rebirth us and Perfect us forever

My Love has a name

He is Jesus, the Saviour of the Earth,
the Life giver

He Changes everything
He is inner peace

He envelopes you in himself,
Wraps His loving arms around you,

Makes you whole, Keeps you safe
He frees you, refreshes you

How Many have tried to portray this love with art,
With music, With poetry, With stories

But still..
A deep mystery He remains for humanity...

Love calls unto you today come into me he says

For where else can you find a Love
so powerful, so deep, so strong, He lasts for eternity.

Chorus
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my soul

Oh for your love that I breathe

You are the love of my life
You are the love of my soul

Oh for your love that I live
You are the love of my life

You are the love of my soul

Verse
I am persuaded
That neither death nor life

No angels no principalities
No no power, none of them

Nor things that are now
Or things that are to come

Can separate me from the love of God
No no

You have chosen me and I'll follow you
Hand in hand till the end

You have chosen me and I'll follow you
Hand in hand till the end

Chorus
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my soul

Oh for your love that I breathe

You are the love of my life
You are the love of my soul

Oh for your love that I live
You are the love of my life

You are the love of my soul
