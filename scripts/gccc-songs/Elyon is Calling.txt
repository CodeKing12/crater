Elyon is calling
Elohim is drawing
He
He will lead us by the shallow water
He

We

Chorus
So we
As we enter the most holy place
We
We
As we enter the most holy place

I don't want to be outside the court

I will enter the holy of holies

Lord I worship You
I worship You

Lord, your name is Holy
Holyy
