WORD SANCTUARY CHOIR
MINISTERING
ALL I SEE IS YOU

VERSE1

All I see is you

As I worship and adore you

I yield myself to you

This is where I want to be

In your presence oh God

VERSE2

As I listen for your voice

You refresh my Soul my Spirit

I yield myself to you

This is where I want to be

In your presence oh God

CHORUS

I lose myself

Soaring high like an eagle

As you carry me with the wings of your Spirit

You
You
