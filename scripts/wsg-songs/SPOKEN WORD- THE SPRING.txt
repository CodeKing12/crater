Looking Back to Retrospect..
I felt so dry and had run from PILLARS to POSTS for HELP!!

But all was to naught..
So many times i had  cry out my LITTLE STRENGTH

Then I realized I had SEEN things wrongly,
THE WAY MEN SEES...

That has always given them the same result
when they think of a better one....

Yes, from a TENDER AGE I had gotten it all wrong....

Blaming others when I ought to STRENGTHEN them,
bruised and ruptured in my EMOTIONS...

Then I realised I NEED HELP..

Right now, I said to myself

I need to wake up cos FAILURE is just an EXCUSE
and a DESTINATION of the FOOLS....

Whilst still challenging myself,
Lo, I met ---THE CHANGER---

The MIGHTY BREASTED ONE!
With the inclination of TURNING NOTHING to SOMETHING,

The one who Gave me the assurance that I can
be BETTER and GREATER than my past...

He said to me come become THE SPRING!!!
Oh!!! WHAT AN INVITATION!!!

At first I did not understand

I asked myself in the silence of my heart
Come become THE SPRING?

He explained to me how that A SPRING
Is  ready to POUR himself INTO OTHERS

He doesn't look for a VOICE cos He's THE WORD!!!

He gives no IMPURITY
Because What made him up is PURITY!!!

He GIVES naturally
Because He's ACCESSIBLE!!

You can't meet Him and lack STRENGTH
Because he can never DIE!!!

He is the STRENGTH of many OCEANS Because he is THE SOURCE!!!

Then I asked...

Who is this SPRING? And how can I see him?
And he said... you have him ALREADY...

How is that POSSIBLE? I have never seen him before in My life
You already see him many times in your Life,

HIS WORD was made flesh and he dwells in you...
HIS WORD is given to you so you can SPRING FORTH his glory

The POWER has been given to you,
YES YOU!,

I mean YOU!
BE a SPRING  that never  runs dry..
