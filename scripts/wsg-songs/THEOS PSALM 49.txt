PSALM 49

Chorus
Hear this all, ye people

Give ye all ye inhabitants of the world

Both low, high, rich and poor

Together our mouths shall speak of His wisdom

Refrain

Those who trust in their wealth
And they boast of themselves

None of them can by any means redeem himself

If any man be in Christ
He's a new creature

Old things long gone
Behold the new in you

Blessed is the man who delights in the word

Who has his heart stayed on the Lord

He brings forth fruit in good season

Whatever he doeth shall prosper

So hear this all ye people

Give ear inhabitants of the world

To the wisdom spoken of understanding

The meditations of my heart
