Crown Him crown Him,
And crown Him Lord of all.

Let angels prostrate fall,
Let angels prostrate fall,

Ye ransomed from the fall,
Ye ransomed from the fall,
Hail Him who saves you by His grace.

On this terrestrial ball,
On this terrestrial ball,
To Him all majesty ascribe.

O that with yonder sacred throng,
We at His feet may fall,
We at His feet may fall,
We'll join the everlasting song.
