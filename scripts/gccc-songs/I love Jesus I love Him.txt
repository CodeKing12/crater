I love Jesus I love Him
when I was blind He gave me sight

I love Jesus I love Him
When i was dead He gave me life

I love Jesus I love Him
When I was lost He became my home

Oh oh oh oh oh

E eh eh eh eh


Ah ah ah ha ha

No other lover will do
No other lover will do
Just give me Jesus
Give me Jesus

No other saviour can save
No other saviour can save
Just give me Jesus
Give me Jesus

Ay ya ya ya ya
Ay ya ya ya ya
