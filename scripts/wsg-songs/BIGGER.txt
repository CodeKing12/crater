VERSE 1

Never seen this mighty God before

Awesome God you are in all your ways

Undisputed no one can contest

Your love it gives me comfort deep within

Demons flee they tremble at your name

Every knee must bow and tongue confess

BRIDGE 1

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus is your name

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus is your name

You're Greater

You're Stronger

You're higher than any other

CHORUS 1

You're bigger than what people say

Bigger than what people say

VERSE 2

Who is greater than the Lord most high

I've searched and searched and yet we cannot find

Defender, Protector, My Rock, My Shield and Strength

Lover of my soul and Peace within

Demons flee they tremble at your name

Every knee must bow and tongue confess

BRIDGE 2

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus is your name

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus is your name

You're Greater

You're Stronger

You're higher than any other

CHORUS 2

You're Bigger than what people say

Bigger than what people say

You are bigger than what we call you

Bigger than what people say

You are bigger than the biggest

You are  higher than the highest

Bigger than what people say

You're Greater

You're Stronger

You're Higher

Bigger than what people say
