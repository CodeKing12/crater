SANCTUARY W0RSHIPPERS

You are the reason why I lift my hands

Why I lift my voice
why I sing to you

You are the reason I'm alive today

I am here to say its all because of you

You are the reason

You are saviour
Ruler, Jesus

You are the reason...

Its all because of you

PRAISES

I just wanna tell you what I think about you

JESSS

You are the first, the last, beginning and the end

In you I live and move and have my being

You hold my life my world my future

All in your hands

And you knew my name before time begin

There is absolutely nothing you can

And absolutely nothing compares to you

I just want to be more like you

I surrender all make me more like

You make all things new

Your love

Nothing else could do

Am in love with you

You are everything

Everything is you

Ate rere ka ri aye
(The sovreign God)

Iwo nikan loba to gba ni
