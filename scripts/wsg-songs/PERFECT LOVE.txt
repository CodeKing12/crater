verse 1
Jah Jehovah you reign in all the earth

We lift you higher you're exalted in our praise

Listen everybody we are come to mount zion

The holy city of the living God

The fellowship of heirs to the promise

First fruits of God and unto the lamb

Serve the Lord with gladness make a

joyful noise all ye lands

For blessed is the people whose GOD

is the LORD for we trust in him alone

chorus
Oh thou perfect love

Everything you are to us and more

Oh thou saving grace

Jesus your name is glorified

Magnify the lord with me

verse
Let us exalt his name together

For the lord is good and his mercies endures

JEHOVAH YAHWEH you are the mighty king

The spirit of just men made perfect

Together we're one with the holy one

Our identity's you we know who we are

So we give Him all the praise

Jah Jehovah you reign in all the earth

We lift you higher you're

exalted in our praise

Basking in your love

We glory in your name

We've been given a mandate we cannot deny

Take the world and give it back to you

As kings and priests nothing else will do.

Jah Jehovah you reign in all the earth

We lift you higher you're

exalted in our praise

Oh thou perfect love

Jesus your name is glorified
