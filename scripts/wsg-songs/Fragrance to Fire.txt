verse 1
The fragrance of my worship

Rose up to the father

Voices,, thundering, Lightening

Were the response to my worship

chorus
First it was fragrance

Then it turned to fire

My worship is my weapon

This is how I take the world

BRIDGE
This is how I take the world

This is how I take

The smoke of my worship

released Upon the earth

chorus
First it was fragrance

Then it turned to fire

My worship is my weapon

This is how I take the world
