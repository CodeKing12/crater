I
New heights I
Still praying as I
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

Lord, lift me up, and let me stand
By faith, on heaven
A higher plane than I have found,
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

My heart has no desire to stay
Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
Though some may dwell where these abound,
My prayer, my aim, is higher ground.

I want to live above the world,
Though Satan
For faith has caught a joyful sound,
The song of saints on higher ground.

I want to scale the utmost height,
And catch a gleam of glory bright;
But still I
Lord, lead me on to higher ground.
