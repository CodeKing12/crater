WORD SANCTUARY CHOIR
MINISTERING
MORE THAN ANYTHING

I lift my hands in total adoration unto you

You reign on the throne

For you are God and God alone

Because of you my cloudy days are gone

I can sing to you this song

I just want to say
That I love you more than anything

Cloth me in your arms

You

When all my friends were gone

You are right there all alone

I
Oh oh oh

I just wanna say that I love you more than anything

I love you Jesus

I worship and adore you

Just want to tell you

Lord I love you more than anything
