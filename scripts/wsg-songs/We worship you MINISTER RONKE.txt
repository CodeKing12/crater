We worship you

Worship you, dear LORD

You're the LORD of my life

You're the one that i cling to

You mean more than this world to me

I wouldn't trade you for silver or gold

I wouldn't trade you for riches untold

You are my everything

TAG
You're the reason I live

You're the one for me

You are my everything

You are the one for me

You are the reason I live

You are the one for me

You are the reason I live

You are the one for me

So why should I fear

When I have you

Surrounded by your love

Your everlasting love

Why should I fear what people say

They don't know

What you mean to me
