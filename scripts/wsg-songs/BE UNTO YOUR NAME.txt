MINISTERING
BE UNTO YOUR NAME

We are a moment
you are forever

Lord of the ages
God before time

We are a vapour
you are eternal

Wove everlasting
reigning on high.

Chorus
Holy holy Lord God almighty

Worthy is lamb who was slain

Highest praises honor and glory

Be unto your name

We are the broken
You are the healer

Jesus, redeemer mighty to save

You are the love song
We'll sing forever

Bowing before you
Blessing your name

Holy holy Lord God almighty

Worthy is lamb who was slain

Highest praises honor and glory

Be unto your name
