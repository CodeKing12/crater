Ohhh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh

Ohhhh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh

Ohhh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh

Ohhhh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh

My faith is stronger than it's ever been before

And I will forever keep my eyes on you

You hold the world in the palm of your hands

And you know my ending way before I begin

So no matter what comes my way

I will never lose my faith

I will keep holding on, to you

And nothing can separate us

Ohhh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh

Ohhhh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh

Ohhh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh

Ohhhh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh

My faith is stronger than it's ever been before

And I will forever keep my eyes on you

You hold the world in the palm of your hands

And you know my ending way before I begin

So no matter what comes my way

I will never lose my faith

I will keep holding on, to you

And nothing can separate us

You are the source
Of my strength

You're the strength
Of my life

You're my shepherd, and I have no fear

I'm holding on to you

You are the source
Of my strength

You're the strength
Of my life

You're my shepherd, and I have no fear

I'm holding on to you

Forever and Always,
I will worship, I will praise

I will Worship, I will Praise...

You Are the source
Of my strength

You're the strength
Of my life

You're my shepherd, and I have no fear

I'm holding on to you
