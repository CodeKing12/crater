You are holy

Holy, wonderful and kind

We are ready

To receive from you, Lord

We are ready to receive your Word

And receive your touch

We are blessed by you this day

I stand, I stand

In awe of you

Holy God to whom

All praise is due

I stand in awe of you

Hossana, in the highest

And our King is lifted high

Hossana...

Thou oh Lord, art a shield for me

My glory and the lifter of my head
