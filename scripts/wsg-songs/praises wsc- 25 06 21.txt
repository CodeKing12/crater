PRAISE

Turning around, It's turning around, It's turning around for me

If a man be in Christ he is a new creation, Old things are past behold all things are new

Whom the son sets free he's truly free indeed, What I'm going through is working out for me

I will be the head and not the tail, Above and not beneath

No weapon formed against me shall prosper, It's turning around for me

I see everything, Turning around for my good

Jehovah turn my life around, He makes a way where there seems no way, Jehovah has the final say

Who has the final say, Jehovah has the final say

Jehovah Jehovah, Jehovah Jehovah

Who has the final say, Jehovah

Abi you no know say Jehovah na God, (Don't you know Jehovah is God)

Jehovah na God,  (Jehovah is God)

Abi you no know say Jehovah na God, (Don't you know Jehovah is God)

Yesu ni wangu wa uzima wa milele, (Jesus is my Lord I'll praise him forevermore)

Wa uzima wa milele, (I'll praise him forevermore)

Wa milele, (forevermore)

Jesus is my Lord I'll praise him forevermore, I'll praise him forevermore

Jehovah reigns (he reigns he reigns)

Above other gods

Glory be to God in the highest, Hallelujah
