The Heavens are telling

Telling the earth how great You are

We are responding to Your love

The oceans are rising

Rising and falling at Your word

And we are responding to Your love

Chorus
My God, how great You are
How great how great You are

Alleluia, Alleluia, Alleluia

How great You are, how great You are


Chorus
My God, how great You are
How great, how great You are

How great, how great You are

My God, how great You are
