Life began when you spoke a word to me

You're the very air I breathe

You gave yourself to me

Nothing can replace this love for me

Can't wait 365 days to tell you

how much you mean to me

You deserve the best every day

Showed me love in so many different ways

Paid the price so I didn't have to pay

Every chance I get I'll say

Happy birthday to you

Happy birthday to you
