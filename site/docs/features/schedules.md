# Working with Schedules

The Schedule Panel helps you organize your entire service in advance. Add songs, scriptures, and media in order, then simply click through during the service.

## What is the Schedule?

The Schedule is your service "playlist" - a list of items in the order you'll present them. It appears in the left panel of the control window.

Benefits of using a schedule:
- **Preparation** - Set up everything before service
- **Organization** - Keep content in order
- **Speed** - Quick access during service
- **Confidence** - Know exactly what's next

## Creating a Service Schedule

Here's a typical workflow for preparing a service:

### Before Service

2. **Add songs** - Add each song to the schedule in order
3. **Add scriptures** - Add sermon passages and any scripture readings
4. **Add media** - Add announcement slides, videos, etc.
5. **Test everything** - Click through the schedule to verify

### Example Service Order

| Order | Type | Item |
|-------|------|------|
| 1 | Media | Welcome slide |
| 2 | Song | "Amazing Grace" |
| 3 | Song | "How Great Thou Art" |

## Tips for Schedule Success
