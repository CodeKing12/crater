CHORUS
And everywhere I go I see You
And everywhere I go I see You
And everywhere I go I see You
And everywhere I go I see You

Verse 1
Lord You're leading me
With a cloud by day
And then in the night
The glow of a burning flame

Verse 2
And You take my hand
And You wash it clean
I know the promised land
Is light years ahead of me

Verse 3
And the eagle flies
And the rivers run
I look through the night
And I can see the rising sun

Verse 4
Well the grass will die
And the flowers fall
But Your Word's alive
And it will be after all
