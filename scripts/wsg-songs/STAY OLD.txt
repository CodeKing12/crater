I know what it's like

To be in the presence of the Lord

And not know what time it is

Because time stood still

And bodies were healed

And families restored

Because we stayed here

In the presence of the Lord

No one had to say a word

Couldn't even make a sound

But I'd give up everything

For this treasure I've found

I never want it to end

stay

I don't want You to go

my heart is burning

In Your presence, Lord

Please, stay

I don't want You to go

my heart is burning

In Your presence, Lord

CHORUS
I want more...

Jesus, I want more

TAG
So I'll stay

Where else would I go

my heart is burning

My heart is burning...

In Your presence, Lord
