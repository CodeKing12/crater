At the end of my worship

The reward is you

Since I have you I have everything

I will ever need

May the love of the Father

And the grace of the Son

And the fellowship of the Spirit

Be with me

Be with me

May the love of the Father

And the grace of the Son

And the fellowship of the Spirit

Be with you

Be with you

May the love of the Father

And the grace of the Son

And the fellowship of the Spirit

Be with us

Be with us
