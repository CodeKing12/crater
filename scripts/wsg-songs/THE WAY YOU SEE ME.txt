MINISTERING
THE WAY YOU SEE ME

Standing in the mirror, not seeing all you say you see

My perspective makes me see myself so differently;

Insecure is now my new reality

And I don't want it to show, Afraid of being exposed

It's not the enemy, this time it's the inner me

Trying to fight a thought of negative inside of me

Can I win this war? Get past the fear in front of me

I let my doubts get the best of me

I won't waste no more of my life, changing how I used to think

There's life beyond my fears, I push beyond my tears

If I could just see myself, the way you see me

The way you see me, the way you see me

Oh oh oh oh ooh, oh oh oh oh oh ooh

If I could just see myself, the way you see me

So much for my life, I couldn't seem to see before

Simply blinded, not realizing God had more

Pursued the wrong things I thought would satisfy me

It left me empty, and now I know

Those stages of my life are over now

My life is clearer, secure in who I am now

I won this war within, I've got my confidence

Those feelings can't get the best of me

I won't waste no more of my life, changing how I used to think

There's life beyond my fears, I push beyond my tears

Now I can see myself, the way you see me

You call me beautiful, never felt like this before

Your love you proved to me

I don't have to walk around, with my head hanging down

I'm loving who I am, not a victim anymore

I love who I am, I love who I am

He made me special

I love who I am, I love who I am

He made me special

I love who I am, I love who I am

He made me special

I love who I am, I love who I am

He made me special

He made me special...
