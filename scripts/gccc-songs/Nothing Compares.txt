Chorus 1
(But) nothing compares
To the greatness of knowing You Lord
Oh no and nothing compares
To the greatness of knowing You Lord
Oh no

Verse 1
Well I've heard all the stories
And I've seen all the signs
Witnessed all the glory
And tasted all that's fine

Verse 2
I see all the people
Wasting all their time
Building up their riches
For a life that's fine

BRIDGE
And I find myself just living for today
'Cause I don't know what
Tomorrow's gonna bring
So no matter if I rise or fall
I'll never be alone woah no
Not alone
