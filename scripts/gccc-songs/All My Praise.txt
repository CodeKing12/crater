Chorus 1
Holy my God You are worthy
Of all my praise
Holy my God You are worthy
Of all my praise

Verse 1
I will follow You through green pastures
And sing hallelujah to Your name
I will follow You through dark disaster
And sing hallelujah through the pain
And even in the shadow of death I will praise You
And even in the valley I will say

Verse 2
You are seated on Your throne in heaven
And You see all of us down here
And You have promised You will not abandon
So I shall not fear
And even in the shadow of death
I will praise You
And even in the valley I will say

BRIDGE
You made ev'ry star
And You taught it how to shine
You knew my name before there was time
And all this was just part of Your glorious design
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
