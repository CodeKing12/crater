O let the Son of God enfold you

With His Spirit and His love,

Let Him fill your heart

And satisfy your soul.

O let Him have

the things that hold you,

And His Spirit like a dove

Will descend upon your life

And make you whole.

Jesus, O Jesus,

Come and fill Your lambs.

Jesus, O Jesus,

Come and fill Your lambs.
