I was lost when you found
You pulled me close and held
And I'm a fool but still you
I'll be your fool for the king

He gave me wings so I could
And gave me a song to color
And all I have is all from you
And all I want is all of you

It's grace, your grace
I'm nothing without you
Grace, your grace
Shines on me

And there've been days
Too much to carry
Nothing left to say
Forgive me Lord when I'm

You traded heaven for a
And all these years you've
You've been my eyes when I

And beauty grows in the
You're oil of gladness in the

your grace, your grace
I'm nothing without you
Grace, your grace
Your grace, your grace
I'm nothing without you

Grace, your grace
Shines on me oh yeah
Shines on me
Shines on me
I'm everything with you

Shines on me
Shines on me
It's your grace
Shines on me
Your Grace

Oh
Your grace it shines on me
Your grace
Your grace
Shines on me
Shines on me
Your grace it shines on me
Your grace
