Ooh

Joy to the world

Joy to the world

Joy to the world! The Lord is come

Let earth receive her King!

joy to the world

Let every heart prepare Him room

And heaven and nature sing and heaven

And heaven and nature sing and nature sing

And heaven, and nature sing

Joy to the world

We sing Joy, We sing Joy!

Joy to the world

He rules the world with truth and grace

And makes the nations prove
(joy to the world)

And glories of His righteousness

Repeat the sounding joy

Repeat the sounding joy
(Joy to the world)

We sing Joy, We sing Joy!

Joy to the world

Peace on earth, tidings of comfort

and joy wash over

Mountains and hills

burst into song as we cross over

There are no limits Heaven has come
(to us!)

Peace on earth, tidings of

comfort and joy wash over

Mountains and hills

burst into song as we cross over

There are no limits Heaven has come
(to us!)

Ooh
