How amiable are your
How amiable are your

My soul longs
My Flesh cries
for the living God

Chant;Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

come Yahweh come
come Yahweh come

Come with your wine
Come with your Spirit
Come in your Glory
Come Yahweh come

Fill me with your wine
Fill me with your Spirit
Fill me with your Glory
Come Yahweh come

Yesterday is Gone
Today I'm in need
Come Yahweh come
