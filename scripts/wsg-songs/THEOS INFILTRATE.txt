WSC UNILORIN
MINISTERING
INFILTRATE

Verse 1
We are an altar of sacrifice

And with everything within
We have pledged our lives

We are a bundle of open hearts

And we thirst and we pray for more of Yours in ours

Chorus
So infiltrate every layer of our being

Saturate every part of our spirits

Consume me Lord

Till all that I am
Till all that I know

Till all that I own
Is all that You are

'Cause I belong in You

Infiltrate every layer of our being

Saturate every part of our spirits

Consume me Lord

Till all that I am
Till all that I know

Till all that I own
Is all that You are

'Cause I belong in You

Bridge
Our motivation,
Our inspiration

Our meditation,
All our relations

Our revelation,
And our definitions

Dictated by You
Consumed in You

No matter the outcome
And when all the doubt comes

You know when they ask us
What's left in it for us

Well it doesn't matter
'Cause down to the latter

We're standing with You
Rooted in You

Chorus
Infiltrate every layer of our being

Saturate every part of our spirits

Consume me Lord

Till all that I am
Till all that I know

Till all that I own
Is all that You are

'Cause I belong in You
