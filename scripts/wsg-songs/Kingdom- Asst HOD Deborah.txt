KINGDOM

For your kingdom will endure, endure as the sun
For your kingdom will remain forevermore

You are the maker of the heaven and earth
(Father of life, Our eternal God)

You gave us life and gave us grace
(Life is he, Grace is he)

Every knee shall bow every tongue confess
(The exalted one, The Lord our God)

You reign and you rule, yes you're King in all the earth
(Only you reign, Forevermore)

For your kingdom will endure, endure as the sun
And your kingdom will remain forevermore

Exalted father, our eternal father you reign, you rule

Exalted father, our eternal father you reign, you rule

For thine is the Kingdom, the power and the glory

You reign forever, Your throne is established

Your law is forever Your word is eternal
You reign...
