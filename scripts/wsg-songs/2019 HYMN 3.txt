NOT ALONE FOR MIGHTY EMPIRE

VERSE 1
Not alone for mighty empire
Stretching far over land and sea,
Not alone for bounteous harvests,
Lift we up our hearts to Thee.

VERSE 2
Standing in the living present
Memory and hope between,
Lord, we would with deep thanksgiving,
Praise Thee more for things unseen.

VERSE 3
Not alone for mighty empire,
Stretching far over land and sea,
Not alone for bounteous harvests,
Lift we up our hearts to Thee.

VERSE 4
Not for battleships and fortress,
Not for conquests of the sword,
But for conquests of the spirit
Give we thanks to Thee, O Lord;

VERSE 5
Not alone for mighty empire,
Stretching far over land and sea,
Not alone for bounteous harvests,
Lift we up our hearts to Thee.

VERSE 6
For the armies of the faithful,
Souls that passed and left no name;
For the glory that illumines
Patriot lives of deathless fame.
For our prophets and apostles,
Loyal to the living Word,
For all heroes of the    spirit,
Give we thanks to Thee, O Lord

VERSE 7

Not alone for mighty empire,
Stretching far over land and sea,
Not alone for bounteous harvests,
Lift we up our hearts to Thee.
Our heart to thee...
