KINGDOM SONG

TAG
We be living in a world

Where everyone is wishing God's will

Yet when God speaks

No one is ready to hear

But we are a people taught and learned of Christ

And we are establishing His Kingdom right here

Our Father, hallowed be your name

Thy kingdom come, thy will is done

hallowed be your name

the whole earth is filled with your glory

the whole earth is filled with your glory

holy Lord God Almighty
