## Best Practices for Song Entry

### Formatting Lyrics

**Do:**
- Capitalize the first word of each line
- Use proper punctuation
- Keep lines short (what fits on screen)
- Break at natural phrase boundaries

**Don't:**
- Use ALL CAPS
- Include chord notations in lyrics
- Make lines too long

### Example: Well-Formatted Song

```
Label: Verse 1
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found;
Was blind, but now I see.

Label: Verse 2
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Label: Chorus
My chains are gone, I've been set free.
My God, my Savior has ransomed me.
And like a flood His mercy reigns,
Unending love, amazing grace.
```

### Line Length

Keep lines short enough to display clearly:

**Too long:**
```
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me!
```

**Better:**
```
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me!
```

### Section Breaks

When a section is very long, consider splitting it:

**Instead of one long verse:**
```
Label: Verse 3
(8 lines of lyrics)
```

**Use two parts:**
```
Label: Verse 3a
(4 lines of lyrics)

Label: Verse 3b
(4 lines of lyrics)
```

## Organizing Your Song Library

### Using Collections

Group songs by category:
- "Sunday Worship" - Regular rotation songs
- "Christmas" - Holiday songs
- "Easter" - Resurrection season songs
- "Hymns" - Traditional hymns
- "Contemporary" - Modern worship songs

### Naming Conventions

Be consistent with song titles:
- Use the most common title
- Include subtitle if helpful: "10,000 Reasons (Bless the Lord)"
- Avoid articles at start if possible: "Amazing Grace" not "The Amazing Grace"

## Importing Songs

### Manual Entry

The most reliable method:
1. Find lyrics from a trusted source
2. Add the song using the Song Editor
3. Format sections appropriately
4. Save and verify

### Tips for Efficient Entry
