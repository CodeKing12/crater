SPREADING EVERYWHERE

My life is upward and forward

And I know no limit at all

I'm growing everyday

I'm a seed of Abraham

I'm spreading everywhere

I do not know no limit at all

I'm spreading everywhere

Like the air

Oh oh oh

I'm spreading everywhere

And now I am Soaring higher than eagles

Just like the air

I spread

I'm Soaring higher and higher

I'm an evidence that He's alive

The world is learning from me
..Iyeh

There's nothing that I cannot achieve

I'm spreading everywhere

I do not know no limit at all

I'm spreading everywhere

Like the air

Oh oh oh

I'm spreading everywhere

And now I am Soaring higher than eagles

Just like the air

I spread
