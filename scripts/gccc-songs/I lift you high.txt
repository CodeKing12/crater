I lift you high oh oh ohh
I give you praise oh oh ohh

we lift you high oh oh ohh
We give you praise oh oh

so much to say but I'm
so much to do but i'm still

so much to do but i'm still
still before you oh oh oh

i'm still standing here

i'm here standing

speechless

so much to sing about you

Ah ahhhh
Ah ahhhh

oh oh oh ohh


chants
