NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE

Nothing is impossible

When you put your trust in God

Nothing is impossible

when you're trusting in His word

Harken to the voice of God to thee

Is there anything too hard for me

Then put your trust in God alone

And rest upon His word

For everything Oh everything

Yes everything is possible with God

Lord I believe

All things are possible

Lord I believe
