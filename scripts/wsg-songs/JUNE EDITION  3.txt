MINISTERING
STAND OUT

Calling on God's people

this is a call to the people of God

we're in a war y'all

it's time for us to stand out

When the enemy comes in like a flood

The spirit of the Lord will raise up a standard against him

I see the enemy coming in like a flood

in our houses,
in our churches,
in our families

But what I don't see is the standard People of God where's the standard at

We in a war y'all

It's time to stand Out

It's about to go down

The battle has begun

It's time for you to choose,
whose side you gonna be on

The devil is recruiting,
temptin' every man

But he's already defeated,
all we have to do is stand

No time for mixing light with the darkness

Be black or be white,
no more shades of gray

Be separated, be holy,
no  matter what you do,
don't bow

And even if you stand alone, stand anyways

CHORUS

Rise up people, put on your strength

There's a war going on and we will win

Stand up and fight, let the kingdom prevail

With power and might, we will stand out

Stand out!
Stand out!

Be not conformed to this world

Stand out!'

Be transformed, renew your mind

Stand out!

Just like the three Hebrew boys,
Stand out!


God is playin' it cool,
don't wanna rub nobody the wrong way

Almost like we're trying to fit in

Acting like we don't know the name

It's time for us to stand out and go against the grain

Forget tryin' to be down, let the world know you've been changed

How you gonna be the praise leader? But you listen to R & B?

And hip-hop is on your ringtone

I'm trynna tell you God ain't pleased

Men with men?
Women with women?

I'm tellin you God ain't gon' have it

CHORUS

Rise up people, put on your strength

There's a war going on and we will win

Stand up and fight, let the kingdom prevail

With power and might, we will stand out

Stand out!
Stand out!

Be not conformed to this world

Stand out!

Be transformed,
renew your mind

Stand out!
Just like the three Hebrew boys,
Stand out!


It's time to recognize

The war it's in disguise

No time for compromise

Wake up open your eyes

The devil is a Liar!

You must be hot or cold

You can't blend in the crowd
It's time for God's people ta -


Stand out!
Stand out!

Be not conformed to this world

Stand out!

Be transformed,
renew your mind

Stand out!

Just like the three Hebrew boys,
Stand out!

Let me hear your war cry!

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

Let me hear your war cry!

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh

Little bit louder

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

One more time!

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

STAND OUT!
