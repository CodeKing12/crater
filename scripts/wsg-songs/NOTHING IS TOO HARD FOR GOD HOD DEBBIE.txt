NOTHING IS TOO HARD FOR GOD

Nada es dif
(Nothing is difficult for God)

Todo es posible al que cree
(Everything is possible to those who believe)

(Hoy la monta
Today the mountains by faith )

Se mover
(They will move by their power)

Nothing is too hard for God to do

By his word all was, all is and made

When we gather, he is there
And when we call he answers prayer

Yes, God is here

And he's Moving right now
He sees all your needs

He is reigning blessings now

Lift up Your hands receive

Yes We have the Victory
Death's defeated
Praise the Lord
