Sitting here alone, thinking of you
I

Time after time, I let you down
So caught up and focused on me

My own desires get in the way

I should be finding my purpose in you

So I can be what you have for me

I need you to search me oh God
I want to be just like you

So that you can be seen when they see me

You known my thoughts, you known my heart

Along the way, I have made mistakes

But thank you for your grace

Hiding my flaws so they can see me

Lord I want change, take it away

Whatever it is, that is my desires

I want your heart

Wasted enough of my destiny

Trying to please those who really didn

Care about me


I
Just for my life

I stand unafraid, desperate for change
Please take it all so I can live free

Cos I have to be more like you.

chorus
Lord this is me
I

I wanna be more like you
I

Oh Lord this is me

I
I don


This is my request lord please
Change my identity.
