I have come To give you twale
To give you worship

And say there is no God

Only a mad man will look into the sea
And claim that the fishes were a mistake

Even the babalawos can testify that
There is only one Jehovah

So who are you to tell me
That my yaweh, dtsikenu doesn

He is a consuming fire o
Yes He is the lion of the tribe of Judah

Him alone shall I serve o
For the rest of my days

My father who art in heaven
I have come to give you twale

To give you twale

Ah to give you worship

To give worship

Kabiesi olu orun

I have come to give you twale
To give you worship
