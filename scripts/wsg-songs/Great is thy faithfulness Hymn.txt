Great is thy faithfulness, O God my Father

There is no shadow of turning with thee

Thou changest not, thy compassions they fail not

As thou hast been, thou forever will be

Chorus
Great is thy Faithfulness

Great is thy faithfulness

Morning by morning new mercies I see

All I ihave needed thy hand hath provided

Great is thy faithfulness, Lord unto me

Verse
Summer and winter and springtime and harvest

Sun, moon, and stars in their courses above

Join with all nature in manifold witness

To thy great faithfulness, mercy and love

Verse
Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth

Thine own dear presence to cheer and to guide

Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow

Blessings all mine with ten thousand beside
