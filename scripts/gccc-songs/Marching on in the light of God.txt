Marching on in the light of God
Marching on, I'm marching on;
Up the path that the Master trod,
Marching, marching on.

A robe of white, a crown of gold,
A harp, a home, a mansion fair,
A victor's palm, a joy untold,
Are mine when I get there,
For Jesus is my Saviour,
He's washed my sins away,
Paid my debt on Calv'ry's mountain
i'm Happy in his dying  love, singing all the day,
I'm living, yes; I'm living in the Fountain

Marching on through the hosts of sin,
Marching on, I'm marching on:
Victory's mine while I've Christ within,
Marching, marching on

Marching on in the Spirit's might,
Marching on, I am marching on;
More than conqueror in every fight;
Marching, marching on.

Marching on with the flag unfurled,
Marching on, I am marching on;
Preaching Christ to a dying world;
Marching, marching on
