Verse
I'm so grateful for the birth of Jesus

I'm so grateful for the works you do

I'm so grateful for the cross you carry

I'm so grateful for the death of Jesus

I'm so grateful for the price you paid

I'm so grateful for your rule and your reign.

Your resurrection power

is so true and so real

Through your resurrection power

we can say we are saved.

Your victory has brought

Our deaths to shame

Your victory made us new

Your victory has brought

Our deaths to shame

All glory and honour to you.
