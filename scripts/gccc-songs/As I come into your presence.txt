As I come into your presence
passed the gates of praise
into your sanctuary
till we're standing face to face
I look upon your countenance
I see the fullness of your grace
and I can only bow down and say.

You are awesome in this place mighty God,
you are awesome in this place Abba Father,
you are worthy of all our praise
to you our lives we raise
you are awesome in this place mighty God
