Thou art worthy, Thou art worthy,
Thou art worthy, O Lord

For Thou has created, hast all things created,
Thou hast created all things,

And for Thy pleasure they are created:
Thou art worthy, O Lord!

Verse
Thou art worthy, Thou art worthy,
Thou art worthy, O Lamb,

To recieve blessing, glory and honor
And pow'r at the Father's right hand;

For Thou hast redeemed us, hast ransomed and cleaned us,

By Thy blood setting us free,

In white robes arrayed us, Kings and priests made us:
We are reigning in Thee!

Thou art worthy, Thou art worthy,
Thou art worthy, O Lord,

To receive glory, glory and honor,
Glory and honor and pow'r;

For Thou has created, hast all things created,
Thou hast created all things,

And for Thy pleasure they are created:
Thou art worthy, O Lord!
