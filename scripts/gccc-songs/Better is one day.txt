Better is one day in Your
Better is one day in your
Better is one day in Your
Than thousands

How lovely is your
Oh, Lord Almighty
For my soul longs and
For here my heart is
Within Your presence
I sing beneath the

One thing I ask and I
To see Your beauty
To find You in the place

My heart and flesh cry
For You, the living God
Your Spirit's water to my
I've tasted and I've seen
Come once again to me
I will draw near to You
I will draw near to You
