TAKE MY LIFE AND LET IT BE

VERSE 1
Take my life and let it be
Consecrated Lord to thee
Take my moments and my days
Let them flow in ceaseless praise
Take my hands and let them move
At the impulse of thy love
Take my feet and let the be
Swift and beautiful for thee
Swift and beautiful for thee

VERSE 2
Take my voice and let me sing
Always, only for my king
Take my lips and let them be
Filled with messages from thee
Filled with messages from thee
Take my silver and my gold;
Not a mite would I withhold
Take my intellect and use
every power as thou shalt choose

VERSE 3
Take my will and make it Thine,
It shall be no longer mine
Take my heart, it is Thine own
It shall be Thy royal throne
Take my love, my Lord, I pour
At Thy feet its treasure store
Take myself and I will be
Ever, only, all for thee.
Ever, only, all for thee.
