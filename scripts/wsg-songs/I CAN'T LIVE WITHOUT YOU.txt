Tell me what can I do

I can't live without you

I can't live without you

On my own on my own

I can't make it, I can't make it

Nothing, nothing absolutely nothing

nothing, nothing without you

Oh oh oh

Oh oh oh

Oh oh oh

Oh oh oh

I can't live without you

verse
So here's my heart

Here's my mind

I give you my soul Lord

Need you to take control

Cause I've tried it

Tried it on my own

but What i found is

I can't make it

verse
I can't walk without you

I can't talk without you

I can't sing without you

I'm nothing without you

I can't live without you

I can't breath without you

I can't be without you

There's no me without you Lord
