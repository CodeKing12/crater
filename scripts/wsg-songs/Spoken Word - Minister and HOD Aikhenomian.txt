What can I use to describe Him

No exchange of Gold nor rubies can match

In Worth, He's more precious than Value

In Beauty, He's gracious than volumes

Oh! The love of Christ,

So beautiful beyond description

From age to age

The love of God stands sure

Ever Faithful

Never-ending

Great is the undying Love of Christ

He came so I can live

He died to set me free

He rose and yes my victory he won

Came! Fought! And Conquered

Out of his fullness,

He released diverse graces to us as a Church and as individuals.

Beautiful relationships

Godly Marriages.

Kingdom homes,

Pure Children.

Streams of Joy,

Conversion of Souls.

Soundness of Health,

Power for Wealth

And Yes! Fruits everywhere.

He cares for us,

Like Mothers care for their toddlers.

His Sweet Holy Spirit watches and guides us

Reminding and revealing his heart to us

The Undying Love of Christ

It brought us together in Wordsanctuary

Training and equipping us

Purging and strengthening us

And though we are many

He engages us one-on-one

Oh How great the Love of God

The same Yesterday, Today and Forever

Common! Celebrate the love of Jesus

Hallelujah
