Onise Iyanu

You are the God of awesome wonders

I have tasted of your power

Onise Iyanu
(Miracle Worker)

You have shown me so much mercy

As much as I deserve

VERSE 1
My eyes have seen, my ears have heard

The wonders of your praise

Creation bows in awe of you

And we join to give you praise

The words you speak turns things around

Your outstreched arms
Has lifted me

You took away the chains and colts that held me bound

Ominiscience, omnipotent

The one who does great things

When I behold the things you do

I just can't hold back my praise

The words you speak turns things around

Your outstreched arms
Has lifted me

You took away the chains and colts that held me bound
