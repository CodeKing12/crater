verse
You brought me out from the World

And taught me the Love of God

You make my life Refined

What a Sacrifice you Gave

You brought me out from from the wild

And taught me the love of God

You make my life refined

I'll Love you Forevermore

Happy Birthday

And Merry Christmas to you

To me...

Happy Birthday

And Merry Christmas  to you

verse
Jesus Paid it All

All to him I owe o o o o

Sin has left a crimson stain...

But he came,

and Washed me white as snow o...

Thank you Jesus

verse
Amazing Grace

How sweet the sound

That saved a wretch like me

I was once Lost

But now I'm found

Once Blind, But Now, I See
