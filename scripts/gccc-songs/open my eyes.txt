Open my eyes
let me see
Open my eyes
let me see you

Open my eyes
Open my eyes
let me see (2x)

I have set you before me
You are my portion
You are my portion
You are my portion

Ephphatha
(Be Opened)

I'm coming out
My ears are open
I'm coming out
My eyes are open
I'm coming out
The grave is open

Make way for me
cos I'm coming out
My ears are open
I'm coming out

Make way for me
cos I'm coming out
My eyes are open
I'm coming out

I'm coming out
I'm coming out
My eyes are open
I'm coming out

I'm coming out
I'm coming out
I hear ephphatha
I'm coming out

no more delay
I'm coming out
I hear ephphatha
I'm coming out
