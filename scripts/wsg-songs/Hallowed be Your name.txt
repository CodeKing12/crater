CHORUS

With open hands we say, Hallowed be Your name

Whatever comes our way, Hallowed be Your name

The One who is to come (we lift our voices and say)

Hallowed be Your name

(Oh Lord) The Beginning and the End (we lift our voices and say)

Hallowed be Your name

Oh, Jesus, Jesus, You've never failed me

You are just the same (the same), Yesterday, today (today)

Take a Look at me, look at me, The one You saved

Hallowed be Your name
