PRAISES

These are the days of Elijah e oh

Declaring the ways of the Lord

These are the days of your servant Moses

Righteousness been restored

These are the days of great trails

Of famine and darkness and sword

And we are the voice in the desert

Crying preparing the way of the Lord

Behold He comes riding on the cloud

Shinning like a sun, as the trumpet calls

Lift your voice is the year of jubilee

Out of zion hills salvation comes

Nobody fit be like my God e oh

Nobody pass my God oh



Wekowiye oghene do

Iye

Iye wekowiye oghene do
