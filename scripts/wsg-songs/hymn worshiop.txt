I

A message, O my friend, for you

’

Jesus said it, and I know

tag

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound

That saved a wretch like me

I once was lost but now I'm found

Was blind, but now I see

tag

Twas grace that taught my heart to fear

And grace my fears relieved

How precious did that grace appear

The hour I first believed

tag

The Lord hath promised good to me

His word my hope secures

He will my shield and portion be

As long as life endures

tag

Glory, glory, glory to the Lamb

Glory, glory, glory to the Lamb

For You are glorious

And worthy to be praised

You are the Lamb upon the throne

And unto You

We lift our voice in praise

You are the Lamb upon the throne

tag

Praise Him, praise Him

praise Him, praise Him

Praise the everlasting King

tag

Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine

Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine

Heir of salvation, purchase of God

Born of his Spirit, washed in His blood

chorus

This is my story, this is my song

Praising my Savior all the day long

This is my story, this is my song

Praising my Savior all the day long

tag

Perfect submission, perfect delight

Visions of rapture now burst on my sight

Angels descending bring from above

Echoes of mercy, whispers of love
