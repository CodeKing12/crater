verse
I sing to You a high and lofty praise

You floodlight me and made me blaze with grace

Oh! What a God, who can stand against?

your face shines as the sun in all its strength

yo

your glory indescribable

y

And your kingdom never comes to end

CHORUS
Oh oh oh... Oh oh oh

You are the great God

You are God alone

Hallelujah Hallelujah

All the glory All the honour

All the praises to the wise King

Hallelujah Hallelujah

BRIDGE
His power no one ever matched

His glory indescribable

His greatness who can deny

And His kingdom never comes to end

CHORUS
Oh oh oh... Oh oh oh

You are the great God

You are God alone

Hallelujah Hallelujah

All the glory All the honour

All the praises to the wise King

Hallelujah Hallelujah
