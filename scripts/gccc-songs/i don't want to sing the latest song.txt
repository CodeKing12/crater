i don't want to sing the latest song
i don't want to percolate the crowd
i just want to make you smile
i don't care who thinks i'm right or wrong
i don't care who tries to calm me down
i just want to praise you now

you covered me in the midst of it all
you loved me and gave me another chance
you saw my need
when others saw my faults
you forgave me
i don't have to listen for my name

they don't have to walk me down the aisle
i just want to make you proud
should i make the hall of fame
or they save a special seat
i just hope that you'll be pleased

You covered me in the midst of it all
You loved me and gave me another chance
You rescued me
I was going to fall
You saved me
So in my life
In my life be glorified
Be glorified
In my life
In my life be glorified
Be glorified

in my life
be glorified
be glorified
