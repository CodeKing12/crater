IDENTITY

You are love

So I am love

You are joy

So I am joy
You are peace

So I am peace

Lord everything you are

Now becomes me

The line between where you begin

And where I end is gone I'm in

You, I know who I am

You're my true, born identity

I'm not the one I used to be

From now there is no separating you

From who I am

You are strong

So I am strong

You are power and so I am powerful

You are mercy

So I am mercy

Cause everything you are

Now becomes me

Anything less is not us

Anything less is not us

Anything else is not who we are
