Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh...

The Nativity of Christ!!

It all started with a Prophecy (in a small town)

â€œ

And the government shall be upon his shoulder:

and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor,

The mighty God, The everlasting Father,

The Prince of Peace.

Of the increase of his government

There shall be no end, upon the throne of David,

and upon his Kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with

judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever

No End..

No end?

Backup to creation when time itself was non existent,

And the earth was formless, void empty

and just darkness. Our aesthetic God in a bid to create,

flexed his vocal chords to form the very first

recorded words "LET THERE BE LIGHT" ..

Let The record reflect that Light came first

Before sin, before chaos, before any mortal body,

Light came First.

This wasn

This wasn

Shining into every corner of the universe

Light of The World..
You step down into darkness

Open our eyes let me see
Beauty that makes this Heart adore you

Hope of a life spent with you

There's a King I've come to Worship
He is The King Of Kings

In him lies all Grace and Glory
In all of the Heavens and the Earth

The Heavens in all Gloriousness doth Celebrate

Even in Music most Orchestrated-
And In Steps most Gracious..

In Words most Hallowed
And in Colours most Beautiful for Sight

All Heavens Lights beams with wonder
Oh what a Joy in God's realm...
So much of Royalty full of Splendour

How much more the Earth?

Sweetest note in seraph song;
Sweetest name on mortal tongue;

Sweetest carol ever sung:
Jesus, blessed Jesus!

He was born Light
Yet Humbled himself in Darkness

Having in him such GREAT LOVE
He went as far as the grave to save our Spirits

Joy to the World for the Kingdom of Our Lord is Established.

All pains,  sadness and loneliness diminished...

Even as Heaven Kissed the Earth in The most Holy Romance;

Thereby Speaking  Beauty into Her.

Vanquishing The Terror of Slavery and Sin..

Let the Story be told again and again
It will never be an History...

But ever alive in us...
A Lamb born to save;

Who then can Stop his REIGN?
For he's worth more than seasons;

And times of the earthly
Which  Speaks nothing but Death...

Jesus is that season of Newness of Spirit
Christ is that season of The Light of Life

Jesus is MORE .... Christ is Massive
Thus CHRISTMAS...

The Sun in the Day would never match up to the LIGHT..

He gave to our Spirit...
Neither will the moon at Night

He is Jesus...The Light of Men..
The WAY; HE IS

The TRUTH; HE IS
He's the LIFE in Our ETERNITY

Made So free for all who Love him
He is Jesus!

The Season for this Reason
"He Shall be born Humble"

As Humble as a baby Born in a Manger
"The Government shall be upon his shoulders"

"A roaring King of this world shall seek to stop him "

Yes!  Herod, the belligerent King,
Demonstrating the frailties of man,

who was King but a boy...

The one who ordered the execution of all male children...

Two years below to be killed.
He reminds me of the world today

Where Merry Christmas is seen as politically incorrect.

Where Ma Merry Christmas is now Happy Holidays,

Where Merry Christmas is now Merry Xmas.

Where even atheists celebrate Christmy, such a Jamboree.

Nonetheless.. Jesus Reigns
" The Stars revere his birth ...

Accompanying "The WISE" whose Wisdom must Worship"
"Taken from his home and Dieing for all shall it be"

Loads of prophesies unalterable
He defied all odds...

Then was our Crooked Destiny Redefined...

Some of you in this building and online
will ask who is this God, well let me help you.

HE IS ; ________________

On this Day and Beyond
We will Sing of your Glory

You're more than a reason
Oh Yes! You are...

We bring gifts from far and near..
To Honour our Supreme Lord...

For you're our Light and Shield

You are the Joy in our World
And Our Eternal Grace

You're more than a Story
You're more than tales

You're more than times
You are OUR VERY NOW!

God with Us! And God in Us!
Oh Yes!
With You being our Every Season,

We Know;
"The Kingdoms of This World are become

The Kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ----
Oh Hallelujah!

Your Reign in Us is More ;
Than a Celebration Limited to a time

It is FOREVER!!!

HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR JESUS And;

Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains

And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains

Gloria, in excelsis Deo
Gloria, in excelsis Deo
