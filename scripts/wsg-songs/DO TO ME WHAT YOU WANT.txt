Here I am in Your presence
Do to me what You want

I'm open before You Lord
Do to me what You want

Here I am in Your presence

This is the place of encounter

This is the place of surrender

This is the place where my flesh gives way

This is the place where my life is changed

Do to me what You want...

The heavens are open, open over me

This is the place of revival
This is the place of renewal

We have come to the city of the Living God

To the innumerable company of Angels

Where Jesus is the Mediator of the new covenant

Yes Lord, this the place

This is the place where my life is changed

Do to me what You want
