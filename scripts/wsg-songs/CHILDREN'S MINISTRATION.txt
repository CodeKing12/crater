verse

Oh yes! We've come to praise

Thanksgiving is as a medicine of Attachment

It keeps us closer to the throne of the King of kings

For we've been called into the Grace of our God

Not only was his acts known to us

But the way of his person too

Unto us hath he made great promises untold

And he's faithful to bring his words to pass

For none of it can fail

For he's beautiful beyond description

Grand and Glorious he is in discretion

His ways are perfect before him

And the intent of his Love knows no bound.

For he's good and his mercies ensures forever.
