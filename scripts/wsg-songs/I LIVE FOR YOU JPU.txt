Big cars, big houses
But you don't know what drives your choices

And you're a slave to them
You claim you want true freedom

But freedom isn't what you're free from
It's what you choose and agree to be bound by.

But I bring you life
That you might have it and have in abundance

This precious life of God

I found my life in you
I am complete in You

Nothing else I wanna do
But to follow you

Yeah you make my life brand new
Yes I do

You gave your life to me
And you made me new

Lord I live not for myself
I live for you.

Take my whole
life and place on the altar

Cuz I live for you
