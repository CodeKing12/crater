WITH YOU
BY BIMBO

God of Love, God of power
The only reason that am still here

God of mercy, your hand of grace
Today my life I

Life was so empty while you came in
When I was weak you showed me your strength

Now I
anything with you

with you I find my strength
with you I can hold on

with you I known I
no greater power than you

no God is greater than you

when I
â€™
?m with you.
