HOLY HOLY HOLY

Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee.

Holy, holy, holy! Merciful and mighty,
God in three persons, blessed Trinity!

Holy, holy, holy! Though the darkness hide thee,
though the eye of sinful man thy glory may not see,

only Thou art holy; there is none beside Thee,
perfect in power, in love and purity.

Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
All thy works shall praise Thy name, in earth and sky and sea.

Holy, holy, holy! Merciful and mighty,
God in three persons, blessed Trinity.
