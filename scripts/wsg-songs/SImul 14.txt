TAKE MY LIFE AND LET IT BE

Take my life and let it be consecrated to Thee

Take my moments and my days, let them flow in ceaseless praise

Take my hands and let them move at the impulse of Thy love

Take my feet and let them be swift and beautiful for Thee

Take my voice and let me sing always, only for my King

Take my lips and let them be filled with messages from Thee

Take my silver and my gold, not a might would I withhold

Take my intellect and use every power as You choose

Here am I, all of me, take my life, it's all for Thee

Take my will and make it Thine, it shall be no longer mine

Take my heart, it is Thine own, it shall be Thy royal throne

Take my love, my Lord I pour at Your feet, it's treasure store

Take myself and I will be ever, only, all for Thee

Here am I, all of me, take my life, it's all for Thee

Here am I, all of me, take my life, it's all for Thee

Here am I, all of me, take my life, it's all for Thee

(Take my life, Lord, take my life, take all of me)

Here am I, all of me, take my life, it's all for Thee
