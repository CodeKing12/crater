THE WORD OF THE LORD

The word of the Lord is great, eternal

And it shall last from age to age

The word of the Lord is great and powerful

He honors it above His name

And it shall last from age to age

The word of the Lord is great and powerful

He honors it above His name

In the beginning was the word

John 1 and 1

Still John 1 and 1

Oh, but if I go over to Isaiah

So shall My word go forth and it shall not return void

Accomplish that which I please

Prosper in, in that thing

The word of the Lord is great, eternal

And it shall last from age to age

He honors it above His name

The words I have spoken, they are spirit and they are life

So shall My word go forth and it shall not return void

Accomplish that which I please

Prosper in, in that thing

The word of the Lord is great, eternal

And it shall last from age to age

He honors it above His name

The word, the word, the word, the word

So shall My word go forth and it shall not return void

Accomplish that which I please

Prosper in, in that thing

The word of the Lord is great, eternal

And it shall last from age to age

The word of the Lord is great and powerful

He honors it above His name
