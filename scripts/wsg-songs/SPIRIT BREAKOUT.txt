Our Father

All of Heaven roars Your name

Sing louder

Let this place erupt with praise

Can you hear it

The sound of Heaven touching earth

The sound of Heaven touching earth

Can you hear it

The sound of Heaven touching earth

The sound of Heaven touching earth...

Break the walls down

Heaven is here

King Jesus

You're the name we're lifting high

Your glory

Shaking up the earth and sky

In this place

We experience Your Kingdom here
