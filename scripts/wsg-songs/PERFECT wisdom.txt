VERSE 1
Cuz if I try on my own I go end up in disgrace o

So everything wey I do I'm covered by his grace o

So if them ask who I be for the matter

If you don see me you don see the Father

They'll be like who comes through who comes through

God comes through God comes through

My Father is perfect

So therefore I'm perfect

I no dey try to do anything on my own

My papa dey lead na im words I dey follow

My father is perfect ooo
