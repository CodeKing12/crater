Halleluyah oh God

For you have fought for me
Defeated death for me

Is far more greater than anything

We give you glory oh God

And we.. de...clare you're holy

You're more than worthy

We give you glory oh God


Send your power...

Send your power oh God

We give you glory...

We give you glory oh God

Same Power
That Conquered
The grave

Lives in me
Lives in me

Your Love that Rescued the earth

Lives in me
Lives in me
