Lord, make us instruments
Where there is hatred, let
Lord, make us instruments
Walls of pride and prejudice
When we are Your

Where there is hatred, we
Where there is injury, we
Where there is striving, we
To the millions crying for
We will be His instruments

Where there is blindness,
Where there is darkness,
Where there is sadness, we
To the millions crying for
We will be Your

Where there is hatred,
let Your love increase Lord,
Walls of pride and prejudice
When we are Your
