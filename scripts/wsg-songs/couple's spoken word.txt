Something's can't be! And I agree

But there's one with whom all

things Can...And He Is God.

Divinity in the dealings of Humanity

Almighty God in the affairs of Men.

In Love, he yielded himself

in dust and thus,

He perfected his Creative

ability when the clefs

of his Word Brought Man into Existence.

And with perfect staves

of Five eternal lines

of blessings from his mouth men became sealed

in his everlasting promise with his

greatest lyrics of Dominion.

But;

"that was just the beginning..

God's Words never fails.

He has proven him true forever

Though Men strays themselves

off the key of Gods music

Yet God, being the perfect

Root of Truth won't change

His Words are Dominant..

His Love Is a Great

Median Reconciler.

So how won't he Save?

"A SWIFT STORY LINE" argument.

You caused this Eve

I could have been better than this..

But your negligence  has

cost us the price of Greatness..

A Prince Born To Rule is now

mixed up with the Marks of the Slave

How won't Striving scale...and you...

Oh Stop it Adam

If my negligence indeed

brought this toiling

effect on great royals like  us..

Then there is none to blame but you

for this proceeds from you...

So why put the Blame on me..

We are in this together

Ah ah...Oh Oh, do you intend

to shut my mouth with

the cunningness of your tricky Words..

Don't even dare cause

I give in to non of those reckless Words...

You are to be blamed Woman..

A Help Meet was your definition..

But what do I classify this

that you've brought us into..

Naked and Stripped..lost and...

Oh, stop this fruitless ranting Man..

You just might not be thinking straight..

Of Course I Am..

You're Not!!!

"BACK TO THE WORD"

This was the  troubled argument

left to race in runs of men.

For Disobedience.. For Negligence of God.

A body once wrapped up in Divinity

Got stripped to Nakedness and Death..

But God Wasn't Done;

Yes, God wasn't Done with Us

So he went further..from

generation to generation..

The Almighty  yielded

himself in man's affair..

Searching for a People to uphold by

the Word his covenant

Diligently Seeking for a

Home to establish his rest

His Glance Caught The Faithful Abraham..

And at Stance of no delay, he was ready to

make with him a Covenant of Nations

But that wasn't enough..

He went further and further

His Hunt caught Judah and he was ready

to give a Lamb for Eternal Salvation.

That still Wasn't Enough..

God went further and Further..

Great God in Man's affair..

He Graced firmly

Searching Deeper and Deeper

Hunting as a Lion does a Prey

Till his Eyes catches yet another people

And Yes He Did

He Found You

He Found Me

Yes! He Found Word Sanctuary

And Taking the World Was Sealed in Us.

And For All this Years

He has held us in the Palm of his Hand

Breathing Life and

Truth into Us By His Word

Which in Truth our Father Gave

In Sacrifice so Precious for worth

And in Love our Mother Upholds

With the Laws of eternal Life

Our Leaders also became the

tables of these great covenant.

Making the Vision so plain to behold.

So How won't we be grateful

and Faithful in  service to our God?
