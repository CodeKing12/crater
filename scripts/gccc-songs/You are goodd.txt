You are good
You are good, oh oh
You are good
You are good, oh oh

You're never gonna let
You're never gonna let me

Let the King of my heart
Be the mountain where I run
The fountain I drink from
Oh, He is my song

Let the King of my heart
Be the shadow where I hide
The ransom for my life
Oh, He is my song

And let the King of my heart
Be the wind inside my sails
The anchor in the waves
Oh oh, He is my song

Let the King of my heart
Be the fire inside my veins
The echo of my days
Oh oh, He is my song
