Verse
This life that I live is all yours

The life of new experiences

Basking in the newness of spirit

Your spirit which guides me all day.

The life of peace and purpose.

Void of the world

A purpose that sees your glory fill the earth.

The life of life and not death.

For eternally I will reign,

A king and a priest unto you

Verse
This life that I live wasn

For once upon a time I was lost,

Without a direction, without meaning.

I was flowing through the motions,

Sunken in the trenches of sin.

I was intelligent in my ignorance,

Skillfully engaging in the frivolities of the world.

Yes, I was all these and more

Until I met with the word of God.

Verse

This life that I live can be yours too

The fellowship of Christ permeating and regulating your day

The fullness of the spirit autopiloting your destiny

The readiness of the gospel manifesting through you

All you have to do is this:

Receive the Son whose blood changed the game in our favor

Hear, hear these words of life with your spirit and hold fast to eternal truth

Repent of all nonchalance to the will of God and call to ministry

Grow in great grace as you take this world back to our Father

Always, Blessed
