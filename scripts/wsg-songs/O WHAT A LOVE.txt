O what a love he has for me

That drove him to the cross

To cleanse everybody

And to bring us salvation

And this is his will

That we all might be saved

He was born to save us all

He was born to save us all

Now the captive can lead captivity

Now we can rejoice and be glad indeed

Rejoicing in his everlasting love

Praise the King of Kings our Prince of peace

And this is his will

That we all might be saved

He was born to save us all

He was born to save us all

He was born to save us all

He was born to save us all

Praise ye the king of Kings

And the Lord of Lords

He was born to save us all

He was born to save us all
