You are beautiful beyond description
Too marvelous for words

Too wonderful for comprehension
Like nothing ever seen or heard

Who can grasp your infinite wisdom
Who can fathom the depth of your love

You are beautiful beyond description
Majesty enthroned above



And I stand, I stand in awe of you
I stand, I stand in awe of you


Holy God to whom all praise is due
I stand in awe of you

Holy, holy, holy is the lord

Holy, holy, holy
is the Lord of lords

i see the Lord sitted on the throne exalted
the train of his robe fills the temple with his glory

and the whole earth is filled with his glory

Holy, holy, holy is the lord

holy, holy, holy
is the Lord of all

saviour, saviour, saviour is the lord

saviour, saviour, saviour is the lord of lords

mimo, mimo, mimo l'oluwa
(Holy, holy, holy is the lord)
