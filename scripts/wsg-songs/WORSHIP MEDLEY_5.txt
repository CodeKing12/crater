verse
There's no shadow you won't light up

Mountain you won't climb up

Coming after me

There's no wall you won't kick down

Lie you won't tear down

Coming after me

Oh the overwhelming

Never ending

Reckless love of God

Oh it chases me down

right till I'm found

And leaves the 99

I do deserve it

I do deserve it

And you gave yourself away

Oh the overwhelming

Never ending

Reckless love of God

verse

Emi mimo feranmi
(The Holy Spirit loves me)

verse
If you're looking for that girl

in this generation

That will serve you

like she doesn't have sense again

You have found me

Look no further again

Jesu my love

I want to make you proud

I want to bless your heart
