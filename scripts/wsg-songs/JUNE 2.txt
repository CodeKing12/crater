I WIN

There's been a change

A great change

There's been a change in my life

There's been a change

A great change

He changed all things that were wrong

He took away the pain

No longer am I the same

And he brought me through the while

And he changed my name

That's what he's done for me

Now that I'm walking in the light

There is no darkness

Now that I've found joy and peace

There is no sadness

He took away the pain

No longer am I the same

And he brought me through the while

And he changed my name

That's what he's done for me

Changed

Changed

Changed

He changed my life

Changed

Changed

Changed

He changed my life

That's what he's done for me.

Up in the morning i rise

With a praise in my mouth

And a sword in my hand

Favour release on my life

My oneness is sure

I'm destined to win

I win

I win

I win

I win

Ohh  I win

Our God be glorified

Up with my hands

I do reign

For his glory's revealed

My praise shall not fail

Victory , I have seen

For his promise to me is

I win triumphantly
