Olori aye otunmibi
Alayetide otunmibi

Olutunmibi otunmibi
O somijiji forever

Ah ah ah ah



verse
Ain't no better place to call home

Than the arms of the one who bleed for me,

He cares for me and
A thousand places that I could have been

But patiently You turned my heart away from selfishness

Now, every morning I open your word and see the

sunshine that lights the path to my future

When they say there's a casting down
All we see is a lifting up

You see we rise up
Like the waves in the ocean

To the earths end we gon' take this revelation

And His kingdom, that's our daily devotion

Born out of light and spirit there's gotta be a combustion

I finally found the place I can be me
The real me, the God me

That's our reality and the King of Kings chose to make this me His temple

We ain't ordinary beings

If no be you I no fit imagine where I for dey who I for be

Im great ful that u came you came into my life nothing remainrd d same

You changed d way I think
You changed the things I do

You made me be as you
Enemies dey confuse

Now everything I do
I do am just for you

If I go sing any time any day I sing am just for you

Shantolo shedebe
Orabasa Orabasa
