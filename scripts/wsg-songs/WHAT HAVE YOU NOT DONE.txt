MINISTERING
WHAT HAVE YOU NOT DONE?

You've  done everything  for me

So I give you the glory

You've  done everything  for me

What have you not done for me

You've done everything

So we give you a praise

So we give you a shout

So we give you

So we give you a run

So we give you a jump

So we give  you a dance

So we give  you a tongue

So we give you a scream

You've done everything for me

You've done everything...

What have you not done for me

Are you ready?
