VERSE 1
When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
When sorrows, like sea-billows, roll ;
Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to know,
" It is well, it is well with my soul."

CHORUS
It is well . . .

in the name of Jesus

with my soul today . . .

It is well, it is well with my soul.

VERSE 2
My sin
My sin
Is nailed to His cross; and I bear it no more :
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul !

VERSE 3
For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live !
If Jordan above me shall roll,
No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life
Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.

VERSE 4
But, Lord, 'tis for Thee, for Thy coming, we wait ;
The sky, not the grave, is our goal :
Oh, trump of the Angel ! oh, voice of the Lord !
Blessed hope ! blessed rest of my soul !
