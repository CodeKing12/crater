CONFIDENCE

verse1
I

Lord I trust your word is true

No matter the circumstance

My life is in your hands

I
So much confidence in you

Your love has been so good to me
So unfailing

My heart is in your hands

You own the master plan

I

So much confidence in you
Uh

Your ways are
Higher....

Your thoughts are
Deeper...


I can


How you do what you do

What you do...


I
So much confidence in you


I

God can
(I know he will)

He will

I
So much confidence in you
