God Favored Me


Verse 1
Love is patient, caring.

Love is Kind. Love is felt most when

It's genuine,

but I've had my share of love abused, manipulated

And it's strength misused,

and I can't help but give you glory

When I think about my story,

and I know you favored me

Because my enemies did try

but couldn't triumph over me

Yes they did try

but couldn't triumph over me.

I'm still here,

I'm still alive,

I'm still blessed,

on my way to

My destiny,

because the favor of God is on my life.

Let me Tell you about love.


Verse 2
Love is patient, caring.

Love is Kind.

Love is felt most when

It's genuine,

but I've had my share of love abused, manipulated

And it's strength misused,

and I can't help but give you glory,

When I think about my story,

and I know you favored me

Because my enemies did try

but couldn't triumph over me

Yes they did try

but couldn't triumph over me.
