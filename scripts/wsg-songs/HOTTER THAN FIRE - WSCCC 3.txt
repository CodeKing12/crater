MINISTERING
I SURRENDER

Here I am
Down on my kneels again

Surrendering all
Surrendering all

Find me here

Lord as I panth for you

I'm desperate for you
I'm desperate for you

I surrender

Drench my soul

As mercy and grace unfold

I hunger and thirst
I hunger and thirst

I surrender

With arms stretched wide

I know you hear my cry

Speak to me now
Speak to me now

I surrender
I surrender

I wanna know you more
I wanna know you more

Like a rushing wind

Jesus breathe within

Lord have your way

Lord have your way in me

Like a mighty storm
Stir within my soul

Lord have your way

Lord have your way in me
