When you come
Then you say no more night
When you come
my darkness disappears

Ro bi ojo

From the womb of the morning
Let the light of your Glory
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah

From the presence of my
Give me the living Manna
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah

Ah ah ah
Ooh yeah
Ah ooh yeah
Ah ooh yeah
Ah ooh yeah
