Where you lead me
Where you lead me
I will go with you
Where you send me
I will follow
Oh, Jesus
My heart will go with you
Oh, Jesus
My life is for you

Dew from heaven
fatness of the earth
Dew from heaven
Fatness of the earth
Grain and Wine
Blessings from above
Bread and Wine
Blessings from above

Let it pour 2x
Showers of blessing
Let it open 2x
Open heavens

Chants: Eh eh eh eh eh eh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Ah ah ah ah ah ah

Bridge: we want your dew
The dew from heaven

We receive your dew
The dew from heaven
