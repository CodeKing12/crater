You exist in time
Before time was and time is
You remain, yet constant
You spoke the world into form
With just your word
You brought creatures into being by just your word

The angels are formed by just your world
I am formed by your word
I look and behold I see the angels crying
Holy, holy, holy
They flap their wings with holy excitement


I wonder what could this excitement be
This sight is too beautiful to behold
Your holiness smear in this place
This is heaven!
This is glorious presence of my Lord.
