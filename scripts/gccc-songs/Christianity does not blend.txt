Christianity disagrees
It doesn't matter what
Or say to our faces and
The standard of our King
As civilizations come and
His word remains the
And the new age no

Women who would hold

Children who would

A people who would defy
Let the storms come
We do not budge
Christianity does not blend

Oh yes, we appear
Call us backward if you like
It doesn't change a thing
Even though we share the

Breath the same air and
We are of a different
A different inheritance
We have been trained,
We glory in shame and

To the praise of the one
The one who has called us
Beyond everything else

We are fire-branded
Not in words but in deeds

we give some more
We do the impossible
And we will do it again
Christianity does not blend

Our life mirrors heaven
Our careers are ministries
Our marriages are direct
We are Christians
We are not Aquarius

We do not identify with
We are believers
Our archetypal

We have proof for ages
Our ancestry is not
We know our Father
Christianity does not blend

We do not identify with
We are believers
Our archetypal

We have proof for ages
Our ancestry is not
We know our Father
