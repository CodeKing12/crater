SPEAK INTO MY LIFE

Oh Lord,
speak into my life

I am
a living sacrifice

Your Word
says live and not die

Oh Lord
speak into my life

CHORUS

Oh Lord,
speak into my life

I am
a living sacrifice

Your Word
says live and not die

Oh Lord
speak into my life

VERSE1
One word
i'm living this moment
on Your word

not just any word
but a word from You

A word that says
I'm healed
delivered
and Set free

there are no more
chains holding me

could have belonged
on that rocky road

if i would have kept my
eyes on the problem
I would have surely fell

i heard a voice say
whose report do you beleive

I said, Oh Lord!
One word is all I need
(Help me say now Oh Lord),

CHORUS

Oh Lord,
speak into my life

I am
a living sacrifice

Your Word
says live and not die

Oh Lord
speak into my life


BRIDGE

One Word
One Word
one Word

one Word
is all I need

Your Word says
live and not die

Oh Lord,
Speak into my Life.


Oh Lord,
Speak into my Life.
