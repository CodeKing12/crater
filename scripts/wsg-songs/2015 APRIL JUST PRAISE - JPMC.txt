MINISTERING
I'M A CHAMPION

Eyes...eyes haven't seen it

And ears...ears haven't heard it

The eyes have cost the mind of men

The plans of God are stocked for those
who love him

He watch as you and me and you

The spirit reveal it

We run here, we want to achieve it

the trial come but they come to pass

But victory is sure for those who love him

chorus
Lift up your hands say am a champion

Lift up your voice say am a champion

Lift up your hands say am a champion

champion, champion

Bread...will level challenges

we're flying high with the wing of the spirit

You see we pay respect to set of rules

On Christ the only solic rock we are standing

V..I..C the victory is ours
victory is ours
