Soothingly

Lovely

Truly

I raise my glass to you

Because you drink from the water,

Together,

I like the way you show the ladder,
To higher,

And because of you we gather,

So thank the lord for you eh

Hip, hip, hip

Loke, loke, loke

We thank the Lord for you eh

Ah, so inspiring
So that I keep admiring,

Never tiring,
The way you keep on rising,

Life of Glory, unending songs of victory

Dancing merrily, we know we can

Because you drink from the water,

All of us, we drink from the water,
Together,

I like the way you show the ladder,
To higher,

And because of you we gather,

So thank the lord for you eh

Hip, hip, hip

Loke, loke, loke

We thank the Lord for you eh

Double double favour,

Double double anointing,

Double double,

Plenty plenty, double double

For all of them we say Amen.
