AWESOME GOD

I never thought I was worthy of your grace

But you gave it to me anyway

And if I took all day
It won

To express my gratitude

You never remind me
Of my mistakes

But you showed me my destiny

What an awesome God you are

You
Awesome God

You hold the world in your hands

Such an awesome God you are

The winds and waves obey your command
What a mighty God you are

Oh...

There is no one like you lord

You
So awesome

Who am i that you

What an awesome God you are..

You
So awesome...
