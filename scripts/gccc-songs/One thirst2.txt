You say to us, "Seek Your face"
Our hearts reply, "Your face we
And come teach us Lord, reveal
Anoint us for the greater things

We have gathered with one
We are here to drink of glory
Here to cry out, "Come and fill
Come and fill this place

And our single wish, our sole
To gaze upon Your beauty God
And we will not rest nor will we
Till with our eyes, Your face we

This place, come and fill this
This place, come and fill this
Oh, this place, come and fill this
Oh, this place

And hallelujah, come
Oh, hallelujah, come
Oh, hallelujah, come
We're singing, hallelujah, come
We're singing, hallelujah, come
Hallelujah, come
Oh, hallelujah, come

Hallelujah, come
And hallelujah, come
And hallelujah, come
Yes, hallelujah, come
And hallelujah, come

We wait for You to come and
Your glory here today....
