I lift my hands in total adoration unto you

You reign on the throne

For you are God and God alone

Because of you my cloudy days are gone

I can sing to you this song

I just want to say
That I love you more than anything

Cloth me in your arms

You

When all my friends were gone

You are right there all alone

I
Oh oh oh

I just wanna say that I love you more than anything

I love you Jesus

I worship and adore you

Just want to tell you

Lord I love you more than anything


I lift my hands in total adoration unto you

You reign on the throne

For you are God and God alone

Because of you my cloudy days are gone

I can sing to you this song

I just want to say
That I love you more than anything

Cloth me in your arms

You

When all my friends were gone

You are right there all alone

I
Oh oh oh

I just wanna say that I love you more than anything

I love you Jesus

I worship and adore you

Just want to tell you

Lord I love you more than anything

praises

Better days are here
I

A new day is here,
I have a fresh expectation

Got a new perspective
And it

I
But only what i hear

Call: I hear
Resp: greater

Call: in my ear i hear, i hear
Resp: greater
Greater, greater for my life

God
And it will last
If he says it

It

Got a new perspective
And it

I
But only what I hear

Call: I hear
Resp: greater

Call: in my ear I hear, I hear
Resp: greater
Greater, greater for my life
