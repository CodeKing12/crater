God of creation
There at the start
Before the beginning of time

With no point of reference
You spoke to the dark
And fleshed out the wonder of

And as You speak
A hundred billion galaxies are
In the vapour of Your breath the
If the stars were made to

I can see Your heart in
Every burning star
A signal fire of grace
If creation sings Your praises, so

God of Your promise
You don't speak in vain
No syllable empty or void

For once You have spoken
All nature and science
Follow the sound of Your voice

And as You speak
A hundred billion creatures catch
Evolving in pursuit of what You
If it all reveals Your nature so will

I can see Your heart in
Every painted sky
A canvas of Your grace
If creation still obeys You, so will

So will I
So will I

If the stars were made to
If the mountains bow in
If the oceans roar Your

For if everything exists to lift You
If the wind goes where You send
If the rocks cry out in silence, so

If the sum of all our praises still
Then we'll sing again a hundred

God of salvation
You chased down my heart
Through all of my failure and

On a hill You created
The Light of the world
Abandoned in darkness to die

And as You speak
A hundred billion failures
Where You lost Your life so I
If You left the grave behind You,

I can see Your heart in
Every part designed in a work of
If You gladly chose surrender, so

I can see Your heart, a billion
Every precious one, a child You
And if You gave Your life to love

Like You would again a hundred
But what measure could amount
You're the One who never leaves
the one behind
