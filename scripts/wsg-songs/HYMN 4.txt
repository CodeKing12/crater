MINISTERING
COME YE CHILDREN OF THE LORD

VERSE 1
Come ye children of the Lord
Let us sing with one accord
Let us raise a joyful strain
To our lord who soon will reign
On this earth when it shall be
Cleansed from all iniquity
When all men from sin will cease
And will live in love and peace

VERSE 2
Oh how joyful it will be
When our savior we shall see!
When in splendor he
Then all wickedness will end
Oh, what song we then will sing
To our savior lord and king
Oh what love will then bear sway
When our fears shall flee away

VERSE 3
All arrayed in spotless white
We will dwell mid truth and light
We will sing the songs of praise
We will shout in joyous lays.
Earth shall be then cleansed from sin
Ev'ry  living thing there in
Shall in love and beauty dwell
then with joy each heart will swell.
