Everything I have

Everything I

If it

Then strip it all away

Bind me to Your heart

A tether that won

And lead me to the Cross

Where all else fades away

And it

Over everything

Everything I have

Everything I

If it

Then strip it all away

Bind me to Your heart

A tether that won

And lead me to the Cross

Where all else fades away

And it

Over everything

Over everything

Oh Jesus, Jesus

Over everything

Over everything

chorus
Nothing can compare

No one can compete

Pearl of greatest price

Worth everything to me

What more could I want

What more could I need

Jesus, oh Jesus

Jesus, Jesus

chorus
Nothing can compare

No one can compete

Pearl of greatest price

Worth everything to me

What more could I want

What more could I need

Jesus, Jesus

Over everything
