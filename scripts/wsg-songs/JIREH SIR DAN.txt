I

Wasn

nothing I can do to let You down

Doesn

I

Going through a storm but I won

I hear Your voice carried

in the rhythm of the wind to call me out

You would cross an ocean so I wouldn

You

Jireh You are enough

I will be content in every circumstance

Jireh You are enough

Don

On the mountaintop I can see so clear what it

Stay by my side when the sun goes down

Don

I

I

I know who I am

I know what You

I

More than I could imagine

And that is enough

That is enough

You are enough

So I am enough

If He dresses the lilies with beauty and splendor

How much more will He clothe you

If He watches over every sparrow

How much more does He love you

More than you ask, think or imagine

According to His power working in us

It
â€™
?s more than enough
