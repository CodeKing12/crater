God of wonders beyond our galaxy
You are holy holy
The universe declares Your majesty
You are holy holy
Lord of heaven and earth
Lord of heaven and earth
Lord of heaven and earth

Lord of all creation
Of water earth and sky
The heavens are Your tabernacle
Glory to the Lord on high

Early in the morning
I will celebrate the light
And as I stumble in the darkness
I will call Your name by night

ENDING
Hallelujah to the Lord of heaven and earth
Hallelujah to the Lord of heaven and earth
Hallelujah to the Lord of heaven and earth
