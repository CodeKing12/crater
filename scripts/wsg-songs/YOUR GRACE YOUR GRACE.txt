I was lost when you found me here

You pulled me close and held me near

And i'm a fool but still you love

I'll be a fool for the King of love

He gave me wings so i could fly

And gave a song to colour the sky

And all I have is all from you,

And all i want is all of You.

CHORUS

Its Grace, Grace I'm nothing without You,

Grace,Your grace shines on me

And there've been days when i walked away

Too much to carry nothing left to say,

Forgive me Lord
When i'm weak and lost.

You traded heaven for a wooden cross

And all these years
You've carried me.

You've my eyes when i could not see

and beauty grows in the driving rain,

Your oil of gladness in the time
of pain

Chorus

Its Grace, Grace I'm nothing without You,

Grace,Your grace shines on me

Your Grace, your Grace I'm nothing without You,

Grace,Your Grace shines on me
Oh yeah

Shines on me shines on me

I'm everything with you

Shines on me shines on me

its your Grace

Shines on me
Your Grace, oh

Your Grace,Shines on me

Your grace,Your grace

Shines on me, shines on me

Your grace, its shines on me

Your grace, its shines on me
