FOREVER/HOSSANA

You are God

You are God, you are life
I will worship you

Into your hands I commit my spirit
You are the only one you satisfy my soul

You are the alpha and omega, the beginning and the end
Forever to you I sing
Forever


You know me before I took my first breathe
And you know the day I will breathe the last

You are the alpha and omega beginning and the end
Forever to you I sing
Forever

Hosanna

Hosanna, I will give you my praise
Lord God, I will sing a new song

Imaramah, you are worthy of praise
Oh my king, you are worthy of praise

Imaramah, you are worthy of praise
Oh my king, you are worthy of praise

Baba chineke, you are worthy of praise

Imaramah Ieze

You are worthy to be praise
Ibumchimo, Umaramah, hosanna
