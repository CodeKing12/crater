MINISTERING
THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE

chorus 1
There's been a change

A great Change

There's been a change in my life

He changed the things that were wrong

chorus 2
He took away the pain

No longer am I the same

And He brought me through a while

He changed my name

That's what He's done for me

verse 1
Now that I'm walking in the light

There is no darkness

Now that I've found Joy and Peace

There is no sadness

chorus
He took away the pain

No longer am I the same

And He brought me through a while

He changed my name

That's what He's done for me

He took away the pain

No longer am I the same

And He brought me through a while

He changed my name
