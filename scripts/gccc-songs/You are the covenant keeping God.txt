You'll never leave me
You said that you won't
You walk beside me
And that is all that matters
You are the covenant

Yahweh
the covenant keeping God

You are the covenant
You are the covenant
Yahweh, the covenant
Yahweh, the covenant

You'll never leave me
You said that you won't
You walk beside me
And that is all that matters

The sun won't smite me
And the moon, Lord, will not
The flood won't sweep me
My Lord, You are my anchor
