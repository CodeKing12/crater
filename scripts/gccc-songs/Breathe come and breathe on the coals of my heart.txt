Breathe come and breathe
let your fire start
Breathe come and breathe
keep me burning

Breathe come and breathe
may your fire start
keep me burning

Set me ablaze, set me ablaze
Till it's all that I know
Set me ablaze, set me ablaze
So I'll never grow cold
Set me ablaze, set me ablaze
Till it's all that I know
Set me ablaze, set me ablaze
And I'll never grow cold

Set me ablaze, set me ablaze
With a single obsession
Set me ablaze, set me ablaze
With an endless passion
Set me ablaze, set me ablaze
With a single obsession
Set me ablaze, set me ablaze
With an endless passion

Your fire, burn brighter
Deep inside my heart
Consume me, reach through
I want all you are
Your fire, burn brighter
Deep inside my heart
Consume me, reach through
I want all you are
