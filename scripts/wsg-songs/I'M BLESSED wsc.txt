I'm blessed
Oh I'm blessed

Going out, coming in. so blessed, oh I'm blessed
January, February to December, oh I'm blessed

Kings shall come to my rising
For I am favoured and graced

In all I do I shall prosper
Everything I touch shall be blessed

From the rising of the sun to the going down of the same
Every moment, every hour, thank you Jesus, oh I'm blessed

Kings shall come to my rising
For I am favoured and graced

In all I do I shall prosper (ah ah ah)
Everything I touch shall be blessed

I'm blessed
Oh I'm blessed

So blessed

Ah ah ah ah

Kings shall come to your rising
For you are favoured and graced

In all you do you shall prosper
Everything you touch shall be blessed

Kings shall come to my rising (Kings shall come to my rising)
For I am favoured and graced (oh oh oh oh oh)

In all I do I shall prosper,
Everything I touch shall be blessed, It shall be blessed
