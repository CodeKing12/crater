MINISTERING
EVER BE

verse 1

Your love is devoted like a ring of solid gold

Like a vow that is tested like a covenant of old

And Your love is enduring through the winter rain

And beyond the horizon with mercy for today

Faithful You have been and faithful you will be

You pledge yourself to me

and it's why I sing

chorus
Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips

Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips

Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips

Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips

verse 2
You Father the orphan

Your kindness makes us whole

And you shoulder our weakness

And your strength becomes our own

Now you've made me like you

Clothing me in white

Bringing beauty from ashes

For You will have Your bride

Free of all her guilt and rid of all her shame

And known by her true name

and it's why I sing

chorus
Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips

Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips

Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips

Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips

verse 3
You will be praised, You will be praised

With angels and saints we sing worthy are You Lord

You will be praised, You will be praised

With angels and saints we sing worthy are You Lord

You will be praised, You will be praised

With angels and saints we sing worthy are You Lord

You will be praised, You will be praised

With angels and saints we sing worthy are You Lord

And it's why I sing

chorus
Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips

Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips

Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips

Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips
