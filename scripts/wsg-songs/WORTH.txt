WORTH

You thought I was worth saving

So You came and changed my life

You thought I was worth keeping

So You cleaned me up inside

You thought I was to die for

So You sacrificed your life

So I can be free
So I can be whole

So I can tell everyone
I know

So I can tell everyone
I know

Hallelujah

Glory to God who changed my life

I will praise You,
(forever)

I will worship You,

I will give You glory,
(forever)

Because I am free
Because I am whole

And I will tell everyone I know

Hallelujah

Glory to God who changed my life

I will praise You,
(forever)

I will worship You,

I will give You glory,
(forever)

Because I am free
Because I am whole
And I will tell everyone I know
I will praise You,
(forever)

I will worship You,

I will give You glory,
(forever)

Forever...

Because I am free
Because I am whole

And I will tell everyone I know

Hallelujah

Glory to God who changed my life

You thought I was worth saving

So you came in changed my life

You thought I worth keeping

So you cleaned me up inside

You thought I was to die for,

So you came in changed my life

So I could be free
