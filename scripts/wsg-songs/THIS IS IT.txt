DANCE(JESUS CULTURE)

I'm after you heart

Should i be still when the worship start lord

I'm so in love with you

What can men do cant hold me back anymore

You spin over me

And you are pleased when i spend myself on you

I'm gonna let go now

Really worship letting me dance come faith


chorus

Dance, dance

Let the spirit moves you

Dance, dance

Holy spirit in you

He turned my mourning into dancing

My heart is full of joy

I will praise you

You healed my body and you made me new

My heart is full of joy

You gave me love that broke down fear

My heart is full of joy

I will sing to you

Oh my heart is full of joy

I wii praise

I will dance

I will sing for you for you
