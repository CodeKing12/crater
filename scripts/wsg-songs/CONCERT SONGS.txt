Forever I'm here in your presence
Hallelujah I'm yours forever

Bask in your glory I'm from above

Now and forever

Cos if I try on my own I go end up in disgrace o (disgrace o)
Any thing wey I do I'm covered by his grace (His Grace o)

If dem ask who I be for the matter
If you don see me you don see the Father

They be like who comes through who comes through
God comes through

Sanctified, Justified, am also glorified
Everytime I see you my life is beautified

Plenty plenty things you don do since you come into my life
My life e better, my life e sweet

Progress dey, I no dey repeat.

My Father is perfect
So therefore I'm perfect o

I no dey try to do anything on my own
My papa dey lead, na him word I dey follow

My Father is perfect so therefore I'm perfect oo

Before before rise and fall na my name
Since you came into my life

I no fit to remain the same

Never stagnant you know o
Light on the hill i must glow o

The whole world must to know o
Mo ti elevate o Mo ti elevate

Mo ti elevate o Mo ti elevate

I'm seated in Christ
My life is rooted in him

My soul is yours

My heart is fixed

In your word

Your Word has given me
A brand new life

Your Word has given me
A brand new spirit

Your Word, your life
Is all I am

Your Spirit is all I know
Is all I have in me

You are my breathe

You are my life

You are my passion.

Oh how I love to lift my hands to you as a sacrifice of praise
Oh how I love to bow down to you as a sign of surrender

When I lift my hands in worship
It's a sign of a sacrifice

As I sing this song of praise to you
You teach me how to live my life

When I lift my hands in worship
It's my honour to my king

All the glory Lord belongs to you
To you oh Lord I sing

I sing

Your praise on my lips
My hands Lord I lift

You deserve it and more
You deserve it and more

With a grateful heart I sing
You have done so much for me

You gave me purpose
You gave me life

All for free

With a grateful heart I sing

You deserve it and more
You deserve it and more

With a grateful heart I sing
You have done so much for me

You gave me purpose
You gave me life

All for free

With a grateful heart I sing

You and I together forever
Journeying till the end

You are my life Jesus
You are my strength Jesus

You are my joy Jesus
You are my all Jesus

I will bless
(Your name)

And proclaim
(Your name)

I'll sing
(Your name)

And shout
(Your name)

Yea yea yea yea
(Your name)

There is nobody nobody
(Nobody nobody)

Nobody's greater than you
(Nobody's greater than you)

No one is higher
(No one is higher)

You are the only true God

Alagbara bi ara eya Judah

Give it back to you

To you my living God
