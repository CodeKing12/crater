Everytime I hear your name I start to smile

Everytime the sun starts shining

Everytime the winds starts blowing

Everytime I feel your anoting I start to smile

Let me take the time to say I love you

Let me take the time to say I care

I love you lord

I'm in love with Jesus and he's in love with me
