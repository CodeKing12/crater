VERSE
Let praises rise from the inside

From the inside of me

May you delight in the inside,

In the inside of me

Come fill my life from the inside,

From the inside of me

Set me on fire from the inside,

From the inside of me

CHORUS
All I want Is for you

For you to be glorified

For you to be lifted high

VERSE
Fill my life till all they

see is you Lord

Glorify Your name

Fill my heart till all

they see is you Lord

Glorify Your name

In my life, Be lifted high

In our world, Be lifted high

In our love, Be lifted high,

Higher and higher
