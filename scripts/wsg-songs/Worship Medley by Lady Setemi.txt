Who is like You Lord in all the earth

Matchless love and beauty endless worth

Nothing in this world can satisfy

Jesus You're the cup that won't run dry

Treasure of my heart and of my soul

In my weakness You are merciful

Nothing in this world can satisfy

Jesus you're the cup that won't run Dry

All my days on earth I will await

That moment that I see You face to face

Nothing in this world will satisfy

Jesus You're the cup that won't run dry

Your presence is heaven to me

Your Presence is heaven to me

oh oh oh oh

There's nothing like your presence lord all i want is to be with you

There's nothing like your presence lord all i want is to worship you

You are God and we worship you

You've got times and seasons in your hands

You called for light out of darkness

You don't need a man to be the God you are

But you have chosen to call me your own

You are you are God from beginning to the end to the end

There's no place for argument

Oh you are God all by yourself

You are God from beginning to the end

There's no place for argument

You are God all by yourself

(The ruler of Heaven, You are the glorious GOD)
