We see your sacrifice

Your undenying love

You gave us definition

And that's more than enough o

And Yet you gave yourself

Gave us a live example

Put us in ministry

You're more than enough

So many people on earth but still,

you Dey make me dey feel

like your one and only.

Characterized by your blessing

and favour na testimony

all this people use know me.

Me I don't know what it means

for a man to Dey say,

I Dey alone o

Cus you Dey stand by me,

in me, for me

and me I know,

I'm highly favored and blessed
