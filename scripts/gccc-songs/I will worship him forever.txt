I know a God who's
Faithful and
I'm the apple of his
The thought that

He loved me when I
And was patient til I
Look how he turned
Made me a shining
His glory to reveal

I will worship him
Love him forever
This God is too
I will worship him
Love him forever
This God is too

Don't look too far to
Just look at me e e
He took me from
Set my feet upon

Ooh oh oh he took
Gave me a brand
His beloved and the
Look how he turned
Made me a shinning
His glory to reveal e

Oh taste and see
I will worship him

Love him forever
This God is so good
I will worship him I
Love him forever
This God is too

Jesus you're too
Jesus you're too
