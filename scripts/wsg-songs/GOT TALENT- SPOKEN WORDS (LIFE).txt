I took a sit at the front row of the CLASS Called "Life"
I made sure never to miss a day

I was so close, I could hear my Teacher's breathe
Yet I saw NOTHING!

Every scene played before my eyes
DEAFENED & DISTRACTED

I couldn't hear a thing, voices echoes in my head

My Teacher saw the frustration and confusion in my eyes, he moved closer,

smiled and said he could help me do whatever I want
Perhaps I need a guide, so i thought he would be one.

Like I was waiting on the love and permission,
I jumped on the offer Freedom on a platter of Gold

Little did I know my destiny was wasting away in the name of freedom

I knew the wrong definition of freedom by heart
I jumped on the lawless life presented to me

I thought freedom meant to be free

I mistook bondage for freedom, Slavery for saviour

Juicy drink of pain gulped down my throat,
I digest it all without a drop on the floor

I became a victim of my own pain, Fright had become a pleasure
Pain is the new Norm, I had been enslaved in my free world

No one could survive without pain, struggle and hardship, so I was taught.

I had poisoned my own self!
Death was drawing close

The sore so deep , I could touch the flies perching on my lowly life
I had allowed all sort in my heart hence i became dumb to the real help

The noise is so much I can't hear myself think
The noise is so much I hadn't realized I had become a part of the noise

Little did I know that in d noise my destiny is important,
as i WHILE AWAY I had lost my throne as a result of my unfaithfulness

I struggled to control morality let alone spirituality
Yet spirituality is greater, What did I get myself into?

Now everything is wrong, I was busy with all sorts save my destiny
Look at me crawling in the place of destiny

Everything slowed down, Something was missing, perhaps someone

I dare not change my teacher, I can't handle the fear of been alone
I have known you all my life, Forever was what he promised

What I need seems to be a needle in a haystack

Irritated by my condition,
Yes, I have a condition that needs urgent attention

I was ready to pay anything, trade whatever
Somehow, I am convinced there is peace for me in the chaos

I need to face the world, held unto something to stay alive
So many questions with no answer

I had thought of giving up, perhaps I am bound to end this way
Then I met MASTER LIFE

He told me I had been walking without HIM
I had only been LIVING

Funny how one could be  living without LIFE
I was DEAD while ALIVE, BUT He said I needed HIS LIFE

LIFE is been introduced to me
Hearing all HE has to offer, I jumped on the opportunity

Oh ! My life has been transformed

Now I got my definition right I NOW KNOW that Freedom is not what
you are free from but what you chose and you agreed to be bound by

I heard and took the heavenly call, I have been called to FAME
I am the greatest celebrity you would meet Now

Reminiscing on the wasted years
SIR LIFE smiled at me and said

let it go

He changed my LIFE,
He gave me a DEFINITION

He gave me DESTINY
He changed my Name

He said I am OLUWATUNMIBI for Christ has birth me again
He said I am TEMPLE for God lives in me

He said I am ALAYETIDE for
Christ owns me now

I am the KINGDOM OF GOD
I am WORD SANCTUARY
