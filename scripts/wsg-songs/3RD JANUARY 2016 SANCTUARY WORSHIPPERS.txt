SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

How can I describe

The Lord that

How can I explain

The Lord that

I'm even lost for words

Oh Oh Oh

My heart sings
Oh Oh Oh

Great is your mercy towards me

Your loving kindness towards me

Your tender mercy I see

Day after day

Forever faithful towards me

Always providing for me

Great is your mercy towards me

Great is your grace
