ALL OF MY HELP

Ezi chimle chimle chimle

Ezi chimle chimle chimle
Ogozrim nla meh

I will lift up my eyes to the hills

From whence cometh my help

My help cometh from the Lord

The Lord who made heaven and earth

He said he will not suffer my foot,
my foot to be moved

The Lord that keepth me

He will not slumber nor sleep

For the Lord is my keeper, the Lord is my shield

Upon my right hand, upon my right hand.

For the sun shall not smite me by day,
nor the moon by night,

He shall preserve my soul, even forever more...
