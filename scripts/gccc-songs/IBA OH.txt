Blessed art Thou
Son of David
Blessed art Thou
Root of Jesse

You are eminently glorious
Immaculately beautiful
I can go on and on
On and on

But my words are not enough
My vocabularies will fail Me
But permit me to cry out

IBA Ooh IBA, IBA Ooh IBA
IBA Ooh IBA, IBA Ooh IBA
IBA Ooh IBA, IBA Ooh IBA

You are infinitely powerful
Magnificently wonderful
I can go on and on
And on and on and on and on

But my words are not enough
My vocabularies they (always) fail me
Permit me to bring this song of victory

IBA Ooh IBA, IBA Ooh IBA
IBA Ooh IBA, IBA Ooh IBA
IBA Ooh IBA, IBA Ooh IBA

You tell the wind
How hard to blow
(Aah Aah Aah)
And tell the rain
How much to fall
You laid the path way
For the Lightning
(Aah Aah Aah Aaah Aah Aah)

Those who are wise
Will worship You
You are cloth with Jasmine Splendor
(Aah Aah Aah)

And wrapped in blistering Light
There's no limit to Your power
(Aah Aah Aah Aaah Aah Aah)
Those who are wise
Will honor You

IBA Ooh IBA, IBA Ooh IBA
IBA Ooh IBA, IBA Ooh IBA
IBA Ooh IBA, IBA Ooh IBA

Elshaddai (Elshaddai)
Adonai (Adonai)
Elgibor (Elgibor)
Elohim (Elohim)
