IN YOUR PRESENCE

Chorus
In your presence that where I am strong

In your presence O Lord my God

In your presence thats  where I belong

Seeking your Face
Touching your Grace

In the cleft of the Rock

In your presence O God

verse 1
I want to go where the rivers cannot overflow me

Where my feet are on the rock

I want to hide where the blazing fire cannot burn me

In your presence O God

Verse 2
I want to hide where the flood of evil cannot reach me

Where I'm covered by the blood

I want to be where the schemes of darkness cannot touch me

In your presence O God

Bridge

You are my firm foundation

I trust in you all day long

I am your child and your servant

And you are my strength and my song

You're my song

In your presence that where I am strong
In your presence O Lord my God

In your presence thats  where I belong
Seeking your Face
Touching your Grace

In the cleft of the Rock
In your presence O God
