You're the potter of this clay
Crafted in your image and likeness
Oh what manner of love
You have given to me

Father!
Oh what love you have lavished
on me a mortal to be called yours
to share your image divine

What an honour
to be ordained and anointed
to be your man and your scepter
Dance in the rythm of your heart

I have a father in You
a good good father
a good good father
That's who you are to me

I have a lover in You
a sweet sweet lover
a sweet sweet lover
That's who you are to me


I have a river in You
a joy filled river
a joy filled lover
That's who you are to me


I have a giver in You
a life filled river
a life filled lover
That's who you are to me

what an honour
to be ordained and anointed
to be your girl and your scepter
dance in the rythm of your heart

Your name
Your name
I know your name
Good Father
Sweet lover
Love giver
Joy River
Way maker
Life changer
