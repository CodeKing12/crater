So we could come boldly

Before the throne of grace

We can feel your glory
as we worship in this place

From the crown of my head
to the sole of my feet

I can sense your presence
all over me

We worship you
In spirit and in truth

Bow down before you

We exalt your name

Lord our souls are thirsty

We cry out for rain

From the crown of my head
to the sole of my feet

I can sense your presence
all over me

We worship you
In spirit and in truth
