I climbed up to the highest mountain

I looked all around, couldn

Went down into to deepest valley

Looked all around down there, couldn

I went across the deep blue sea

Couldn

Nobody greater

Searched all over

I looked high and low

Nobody greater

Nobody can heal

Oh most holy one you are then great I Am

Awesome in all your ways and mighty is your hand

You are He who carried out redemption

You are He who carried out redemption


I just want to be more like you

I surrender all make me more like

You make all things new

Your love

Nothing else could do

Am in love with you

You are everything

Everything is you

If we call to him

He will answer us


If we run to him

If we lift our hands

He will lift us up


Come let's praise His name

Oh ye saints of God


Oh sing for joy to God our strength

Oh sing for joy to God our strength

Our strength
