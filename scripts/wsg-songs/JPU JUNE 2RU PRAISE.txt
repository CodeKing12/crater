THOU OH LORD

VERSE1
Many are they increased
that trouble me

Many are they that rise up
against me

Many they be which say of my soul

There is no help for me in God

Chorus
But thou oh lord art a shield for me

My glory and the lifter of my head

Thou oh lord art a shield for me

My glory and the lifter of my head

We join with the angels adoration

we bow casting down our golden crowns and

we call to the father God almighty

we cry holy holy holy

Holy you are holy
Holy you are holy
Holy you are holy

oh oh oh Lord
Yes you are HOLY

Holy holy holy
Lord God almighty

All thy works shall praise thy name

in earth and sky and seas

holy holy holy
merciful and mighty

God in three persons
Blessed trinity
