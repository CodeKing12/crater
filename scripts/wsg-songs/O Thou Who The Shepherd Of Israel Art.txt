O Thou Who the Shepherd of Israel art,
Give ear to our pray'r and Thy favor impart;
Thou Leader of Joseph, Thou Guide of his way,
'Mid cherubim dwelling, Thy glory display.

In Ephraim's, Manasseh's and Benjamin's sight,
O come Thou and save us; awake in Thy might.
O God, give us favor, restore to Thy grace;
And then we shall live in the light of Thy face.

From Egypt's dark border a vine Thou didst take;
Destroying the heathen didst room for it make.
Where planted it grew at Thy sov'reign command,
With roots deeply set and boughs filling the land.

The axe hews it down; it is burned in the fire;
They perish, rebuked in Thy terrible ire.
O lay then Thy hand on the Man of Thy might,
The Son of Man made to stand strong in Thy sight.

No more shall we wander, delighting in shame;
Revive us, O Lord, we will call on Thy Name.
O Lord God of Hosts, us restore to Thy grace,
And then we shall live in the light of Thy face.
