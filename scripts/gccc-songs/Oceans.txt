You call me out upon the waters
The great unknown where feet may fail
And there I find You in the mystery
In oceans deep
My faith will stand

And I will call upon Your name
Kilo And keep my eyes above the
When oceans rise, my soul will rest in
For I am Yours and You are mine

Your grace abounds in deepest waters
Your sovereign hand
Will be my guide
Where feet may fail and fear surrounds
You've never failed and You won't start

So I will call upon Your name
And keep my eyes above the waves
When oceans rise, my soul will rest in
For I am Yours and You are mine

Spirit lead me where my trust is without
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Savior
