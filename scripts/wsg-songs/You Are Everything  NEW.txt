You Are Everything

TAG1
You are the only one we see

Even in our very dreams

When we think about your grace

We're changed into the same image

TAG2
You are everything that we are

You are why we live, why we breathe

It's all because of you Jesus

You are in us and we're in you

You are everything

TAG3
You came to earth to pay a price

That was the greatest sacrifice

For our sins you were crucified

Now you have given us your Life

TAG 4
We will preach the gospel

To the ends of the earth

You've given us the power
l
Now we are your witness

Every knee will bow down

Every tongue will confess

Jesus Christ is Lord

Jesus Christ is Lord
