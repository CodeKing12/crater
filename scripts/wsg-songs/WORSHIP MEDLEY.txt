WORSHIP MEDLEY

At the mention of Your name

Every knee shall bow

At the mention of Your name

Every tongue confess

He is Lord...

Oh oh oh...

I lift my hands to You

I lift my voice

I lift my life to you

I lift my life

I give my everything

You are my King

I worship you


Yeah,
He's mine

Yeah,
Saviour(Redeemer)


You take my breathe away

You take my breathe away, whoa

Unending, but always on time

Unfailing, but never unkind

Unmerited favour is mine

Undeserving, Oh, but I receive your

Grace, Lord your grace

Oh I need it, I receive it

I'm amazed, so amazed

When I see it, I am speechless...
