GREAT GOD

He's a great God

Great God

Let the world know you serve a great God

He's a great God

Great God

Hands in the air if you serve a great God

All through the day and through the night

There are angels watching over my life
I'm grateful

I'm not afraid of arrows by day

Or terrors that may come through the night

We all can say he's a great God
