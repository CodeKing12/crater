When I lift my hands in worship

It

As I sing this song of praise to you

You teach me how to live my life

When I lift my hands in worship

It

All the glory Lord belongs to you

To you ohh lord I sing

I sing

Oooh oooh ooooh

I sing

BRIDGE
Your praise on my lips

My hands lord I lift

You deserve it and more

IBA ooh IBA (Reverence)

Blessed art Thou

Rock of ages

Blessed art Thou

King of Heaven

Blessed art Thou

Root of jason

Blessed art Thou

King of Heaven

You are infinitely powerful

Magnificently wonderful

I can go on and on

And on and on and on and on

But my words are not enough

My vocabularies they (always) fail me

Permit me to bring this song of victory

IBA Ooh IBA IBA IBA
(Reverence)
