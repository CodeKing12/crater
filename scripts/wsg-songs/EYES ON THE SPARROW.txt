Why do we soar higher

And testify of the shadows gone

Here in my heart is heaven

and Peace forever and on

When Jesus is my portion

Our constant friend is he

His eyes are on the Sparrow

And I know he watches over me

His eyes are on the Sparrow

And I know he watches me

CHORUS
I sing Because I'm Happy

I sing because I'm free

His eyes are on the Sparrow

And I know he watches me

His eyes are on the Sparrow

And I know he watches

I know he watches

I know he watches me

I....I sing Because I'm Happy
