When I am a wasteland
You are the water
when i am the winter
you are the fire that burns

when I am the long night
you are the sunrise
when i am the desert
you arre the river that turns

what I have done to deserve
what I have done to deserve
I cannot earn what You so
What have I done to deserve

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
