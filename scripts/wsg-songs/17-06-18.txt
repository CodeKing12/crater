SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

Standing here

Knowing how I

Holding unto faith You know that

Nothing can catch You by surprise

You got this figured out

And You

But when it looks
As if we can

You wrap us in Your arms and step in

And everything we need
You supply

You got this in control
and now we know that

You made a way

When our backs were against
the wall

And it looked as if it was over

You made a way

And we
Only because You made a way

You move mountains
You cause wall to fall

With Your power
Perform miracles

There is nothing that

And we
Only because You made a way

You made a way

All things are working for my Good

He
Never failing

I don

He's working for me

Your Love has taken over me
Father I depend on You

I have confidence in You
In You oh LORD I put my trust

Cause You cover me
Under the canopy
Give me security
