WORD SANCTUARY CHOIR
MINISTERING
GRATEFUL HEART


Step to the floor step to the show

In this house we are gathered to celebrate to jubilate

When I ponder on His wonder

I feel so speechless I wonder

I came to His presence this time around
With A grateful heart

A grateful heart
A grateful heart
A grateful heart
A grateful heart

Left his glory step down to groaning took my place and now I am free

SECOND RAPPER

Every day we fresh like the dew in the morning

Earnesting the package that comes with the season

My homie scream all hails to big JC

Representing the kingdom of God they taught we crazy

What more can I say maybe I should speak in tongues

Maybe I should sing a song and call it a sing along

Come join me sing a song dedicated to Jesus

The way I see it I

The light from within Jesus music turn ace

Need to rehab cause someone tranna set the pace
