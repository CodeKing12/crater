SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

You are the reason why I lift my hands

Why I lift my voice
why I sing to you

You are the reason I'm alive today

I am here to say its all because of you

You are the reason

You are saviour
Ruler, Jesus

You are the reason...

Its all because of you

I don't have to listen for my name

They don't have to walk me down the aisle

I just wanna make you proud

Should I make the hall of fame

Or they save a special seat

I just hope that you

You covered me in the midst of it all

You love me, gave me another chance

You rescued me

I was going to fall , going to fall

You saved me

(So in my life)

In my life

Be glorified (yeah

You get the praise

You take the honor
