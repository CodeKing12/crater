If the altar is where
Take me there, take
What you need is just
It's right here, my life
And I'll be a living
You're a fire
The refiner
I wanna be consumed

I wanna be tried by
Purified
You take whatever
Lord here's my life
I wanna be tried by
Purifed
You take whatever
Lord here's my life

If your glory wants
Let it fall, we want
Lord your fire is
Fill this place, set it
I'll be a living

You're a fire
The refiner
I wanna be
I wanna be tried by
Purified
You take whatever
Lord here's my life

I wanna be tried by
Purifier
You take whatever
Lord here's my life

Clean my hands,
I wanna burn for
Take my life as a
I wanna burn for
