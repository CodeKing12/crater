I don't need to look around

To tell How great You are

You've been good Lord

You've been good lord

I don't need to go too far

To understand Your grace

You've been good Lord

You've been good lord

How great You are

How great You are

Hallelujah to the Lord

How great You are

That's who You are

That's who You are

Greatly to be praised

That's who You are

How great You are

How great You are

Ha - lle - lu - jah

Hallelujah to the Lord

How great You are

Ha - lle - lu - jah

Greatly to be praised

That's who You are
