MINISTERING
MATTHEW 28 vs 40

Destroy this temple and in three days, I will raise it up

Early Sunday morning as the noon day was dawning

Came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to the tomb

Behold! There was a great earthquake!

For the angel of the Lord descended from Heaven

The angel of the Lord descended from Heaven

And rolled, rolled

And rolled

Back the stone

His countenance was like lightening and his raiment was as white

And for fear of Him the keepers did shake and became as dead

Fear not.

For I know ye seek Jesus who was crucified

He is not here

For He has risen as he said

Yeah!

See the place where the Lord lay

Fear not.

For I know ye seek Jesus who was crucified

He is not here

For He has risen as he said

Yeah!

See the place where the Lord lay

Remember how He said while He was yet in Galilee

I'll rise, I'll rise, Again

Alleluia

Amen
