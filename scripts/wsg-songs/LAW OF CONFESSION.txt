WORD SANCTUARY CHOIR
MINISTERING
'LAW OF CONFESSION'


man can't cannot live by bread alone

but by every word out of the mouth of God

There's a formula for confession

that can help you live your best life

A law is simply a principle based on a
predictable
consequence of an act

confession in greek is HOMOLOGEO

which means to say what has been said

Chorus
There is a law of Confession

you just say what God has said

Speak the word

you just speak the word

bridge
I can do all things through Christ that
strengthens me

Greater is He that is in me
Than he that is in the world

No weapon formed shall prosper

By His Stripes we are healed

We are healed
