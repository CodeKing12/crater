LET THE WORDS

Verse
Keep back Your servant from presumptuous sins
Let them not have dominion over me

Then shall I be upright and innocent
From great transgression

Chorus
Let the words Of my mouth
And the meditation Of my heart

Be acceptable In Your sight, O Lord

Bridge
Keep back Your servant from presumptuous sins
Let them not have dominion over me

Then shall I be upright and innocent
From great transgression

Chorus
Let the words Of my mouth
And the meditation Of my heart

Be acceptable In Your sight, O Lord
