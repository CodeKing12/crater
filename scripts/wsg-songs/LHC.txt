MINISTERING
GRACE TO GRACE

VERSE 1
If love endured that ancient cross

How precious is my Saviour

The beauty of heaven wrapped in my shame

The image of love upon death

BRIDGE
If having my heart was worth the pain

What joy could You see beyond the grave

If love found my soul worth dying for

VERSE 2
How wonderful How glorious

My Saviour

Victorious

My chains are gone

My debt is paid

From death to life

And grace to grace

VERSE 3
If heaven now owns that vacant tomb

How great is the hope that lives inYou

The passion that tore

Through hell like a rose

The promise that rolled back

Death and its stone

BRIDGE
If freedom is worth the life You raised

Oh where is my sin where is my shame

If love paid it all to have my heart

VERSE 4
When I see that cross I see freedom

When I see that grave I

And from death to life

I will sing Your praise

In the wonder of Your grace

BRIDGE
How my soul will sing Your praise

In the wonder of Your grace

How my soul will sing Your praise
