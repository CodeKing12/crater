In Jesus, there's a treasure untold,
More valuable than silver or gold,
It's a love that will never grow old,
His grace never leaves us alone

I have found a treasure no one can take from my hands
I have found a treasure no one can take from my
Jesus is my treasure
Jesus is my treasure

I will not make gold
my hope
Nor say to fine gold
You are my confidence
I will not rejoice because my earthly wealth is great

I can
and be overdrawn by any earthened throne
The maker of the heaven
