MINISTERING
NOEL

The First No
the Angels did say

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay

In fields where they lay
keeping their sheep

On a cold winter's night
that was so deep

No
Born is the King of Israel

(No

They looked up and saw a star

Shining in the East
beyond them far

And to the Earth it gave great light

And so it continued both day and night

No
Born is the King of Israel

No
Born is the King of Israel

No
Born is the King of Israel

Born is the King of Israel...
