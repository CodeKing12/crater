There's a miracle in this room

With my name on it

There's a healing in this room

And it's here for me

There's a breakthrough in this room

And it's got my name on it

So I'm gonna put a praise on it

I'm gonna put a praise on it

Somebody put a praise on it

At the center of it all

It's you that I see

At the center of it all

It's you that I see

There is power in your name

Miracles happen in your name

As we lift our voice in praise

It's you that I see

You are bigger bigger than the biggest

You are stronger stronger than the strongest

You are higher higher than the highest

You are greater greater than the greatest

Jesus

There's power in the name of Jesus

To break every chain

There's an army rising up

To break every chain
