What can wash away my
Nothing but the blood of
What can make me whole
Nothing but the blood of

Oh, precious is the flow
That makes me white as
Oh, no other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of
Ooh, ooh

For my cleansing, this I
Nothing but the blood
For my pardon this my
Nothing but the blood

Oh, precious is the flow
That makes me white
Oh, no other fount I
Nothing but the blood
Ooh, ooh

Nothing can my sin
This is all my hope and
This is all my
Nothing but the blood
Nothing but the blood
Oh, precious is the flow
That makes me white
Oh, no other fount I
Nothing but the blood
Nothing but the blood
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh
