I
He
He
The
All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole

Chorus
In sorrow He
In trouble He
He tells me every care on Him to roll,
He
The Bright and Morning Star

Verse 2
He all my grief
And all my sorrow borne,
In temptation He
I
From my heart, and now
He keeps me by His power.

Though all the world forsake me,
And Satan tempt me sore,
Through Jesus I shall safely reach the goal,
He
The Bright and Morning Star
He

Verse 3
He
Nor yet forsake me here,
While I live by faith, and do His blessed will
A wall of fire about me,
I
With His manna He my hungry soul shall fill

Then sweeping up to glory,
To see His blessed face,
Where river of delight shall ever roll,
He
The Bright and Morning Star
He
