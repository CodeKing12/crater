In the crushing
In the pressing
You are making new wine
In the soil
I now surrender
You are breaking new

So I yield to You into Your
When I trust You I don't

Make me Your vessel
Make me an offering
Make me whatever You want
I came here with nothing
But all You have given me
Jesus bring new wine out of

So, make me Your vessel
Make me an offering
Make me whatever
You want me to be
I came here with nothing
But all You have given me
Jesus, bring new wine out of

Jesus, bring new wine out of
Jesus, bring new wine out of

'Cause where there is new
There is new power
There is new freedom
And the Kingdom is here
I lay down my old flames
To carry Your new fire today

I lay down my old flames
To carry Your new fire today

you are breaking new ground
you are making new wine
