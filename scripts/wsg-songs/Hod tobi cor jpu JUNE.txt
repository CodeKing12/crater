Ruptured, rumpled, dased with blows of unfaithfulness

Broken, shattered and bruised, like a battered slave

Left in the dark and long forgotten

No shape, all seems done and left to die

Was given to nothing and left in the shadow of failure

From the beginning of age it was not so

Tied down in the world of slavery is my beauty now

Soaked in the issues of life

Could not come out therefore soaked in it

The calamities of this elites of the gospel,

brought me so low to the ground

Those who could help brought the little they could

But all was to naught

Because it was from their own ignorance

My anxieties is deep that one could touch
One could tell I am clothed in rag

I knew a lot, yet they made me know nothing

All the Knowledge I gathered has been nolified

Things has fallen apart

Because its not according to pattern

The house that was built by the hard labour

of the master is now disarrayed and rearranged   to their tastes

Its the work of this ran chorus elites of the gospel

The blood of this loving hero that was hung

on the tree is now used to roast their sinful chickens

Eaten together with their friends the enemy of the gospel

Gathered together in their uniforms of lies

They are sitted together with the same ideologies of ignorance

The communication of failure foams like soap on their mouths

Going around, holding crusades,

holding shows and conventions that can't manage a cat's spirituality

Its so amazing how they are commuted to their fruitlessness

The pattern has been bruised, torn apart and manipulated

No wonder, lies and cheats is the message of the church

Massive corruption in church bit no lives made

Building increasing but leaders decreasing

Church members increasing but ~desciples~ decreasing

But here we are standing

We have come to raise up the

fallen pattern of the master

Up up up in the sky the banner will soar

We will not sleep nor wink till we

mend the altar of the father

We are here the holy sons of Israel to restore the lost

We are here to mend the broken breaches

We are here to restore the nations unto our God and father

We are the army of the lord
