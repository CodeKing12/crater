If a man be in Christ he is a new creation

Old things are past behold all things are new

Whom the son sets free he's truly free indeed

What I'm going through is working out for me

I will be the head and not the tail

Above and not beneath

No weapon formed against me shall prosper
It's turning around for me

I see everything
Turning around for my good

Turning around for my good
Turning around for my good

Jehovah turn my life around

He makes a way where there seems no way

Jehovah has the final say
