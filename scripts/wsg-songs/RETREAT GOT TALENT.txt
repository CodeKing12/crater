you have given to me my portion

i have gone with it

without caution

before i know i missed the way

before i know i missed the way

CHORUS

the lost sheep that you love

the lost sheep that you love

here i am find me back

here i am find me way

VERSE 2

i look around i can't see

i search around i can't find

where to go to see your face

where to go to find my way

CHORUS

the lost sheep that you love

the lost sheep that you love

here i am find me back

here i am find me way

VERSE 3

i cried out from the wild

i cried out from a miles

i know no more my way

i know no more my way

CHORUS

the lost sheep that you love

the lost sheep that you love

here i am find me back

here i am find me way

BRIDGE

OH OH OH....

find me way to your way

till i find my way back to your side

find me way to your way

till i find my way back to you

END

Here i am the lost sheep that you love
