MINISTERING
JESUS CULTURE - DANCE

I'm after your heart,
Why should I be still
When the worship starts Lord

I'm so in love with you
What can man do
Can't hold me back anymore

You spin over me, and you
are pleased when I spend myself on you

I'm gonna let go now really worship
Letting my dance come forth

Chorus
Dance, dance

Let the Spirit move you
Dance, dance

Holy Spirit in you

Turn my mourning into dancing
My heart is full of joy
I will praise you

You healed my body
And you made me new
My heart is full of joy
I will dance for you

You gave me love
That broke down fear
My heart is full of joy
I will sing to you

Chorus
Dance, dance

Let the Spirit move you
Dance, dance

Holy Spirit in you
