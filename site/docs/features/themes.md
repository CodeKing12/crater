# Working with Themes

Themes control how your content looks on the projection screen. Customize colors, fonts, backgrounds, and text positioning to match your church's style.

## What Are Themes?

A theme defines the visual appearance of projected content:

- **Background** - Color, image, or transparency
- **Text Style** - Font, size, color
- **Layout** - Where text appears on screen
- **Effects** - Shadows, outlines, and more

## Theme Types

Crater uses different themes for different content types:

## Theme Best Practices

### Readability First

- **High contrast**: Light text on dark backgrounds or vice versa
- **Large text**: Scripture and lyrics should be readable from the back row
- **Simple fonts**: Avoid decorative fonts that are hard to read
- **Minimal clutter**: Keep backgrounds simple

### Consistency

- Use the same theme throughout a service when possible
- Match your church's branding (colors, fonts)
- Keep song and scripture themes visually compatible

### Testing

- Always test themes on the actual projection
- View from different parts of the room
- Check readability in various lighting conditions

## Recommended Settings

### Text Size
- Scripture/Lyrics: 48-72pt (adjust based on room size)
- References: 24-36pt
- Section labels: 18-24pt

### Colors
- Dark backgrounds: #1a1a1a, #2d2d2d, #000000
- Light text: #ffffff, #f0f0f0
- Accent colors: Match your church brand

### Fonts
- Sans-serif fonts are typically most readable
- Popular choices: Arial, Open Sans, Roboto, Lato
- Avoid thin font weights on projectors

## Common Theme Issues

### Text too small

- Edit the theme
- Increase font size
- Save and test again

### Hard to read

- Increase contrast between text and background
- Add text shadow or outline
- Use a different background

### Text cut off

- Adjust text positioning
- Reduce font size if needed
- Check container margins

### Background image distracting

- Use a darker or blurred background
- Reduce background opacity
- Choose a simpler image
