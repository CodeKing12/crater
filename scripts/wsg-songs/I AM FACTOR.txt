MINISTERING
I AM FACTOR

VERSE

I left my name for generations to come

A name above all names I AM and is to come

The heavens respond the universe

Obeys when you say I AM

I AM What you decree must come your way

Confess I AM that I AM  I AM

BRIDGE
Heaven must answer back

The universe must react

Confess your I AM'S daily

Make a decree prophetically

when you say,
I AM, I AM,

What you decree must come your way

Confess I AM that I AM that I AM

Confess I AM to turn sickness to health

Confess I AM to turn lack into wealth

The heavens respond

The universe obeys when you say I AM

I AM

what you decree must come your way

Confess I AM that I AM that I AM

When you confess I AM

Heaven must answer back

When you confess I AM

The universe must react

I AM....

I AM NOT....
