Spirit of the sovereign Lord
Come and make your presence known
Reveal the glory of the risen God

Let the weight of Your glory cover us
Let the life of Your river flow
Let the truth of your kingdom reign in
Let the weight of your glory fall


Lord I lift Your Name on High
You came from heaven to earth
to show the way
from the earth to the cross my debt
from the cross to the grave
From the grave to the sky
Lord I lift your name on high

When Jesus came down
He came down from heaven
When he landed, he landed in israel
There was trouble he came down to
We must praise Him in the African way

aye oooo,
