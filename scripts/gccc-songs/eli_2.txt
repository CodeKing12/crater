Every knee shall bow to you
Every tongue confess of you
You are the king of glory
You are the lord almighty
Every knee shall bow to you
Every tongue confess of you
You are the king of glory
You are the lord of the earth....

Eli, you are my God( 4x
Cry aloud Jerusalem
Proclaim his ways messengers of the king
Eli you are my God.

Most high, king of the universe
El-elyon is your name
You are the king of zion
The one that sits on the throne
First and the last
Beginning and the end.....

Cry aloud Jerusalem
The king is come
