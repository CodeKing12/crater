MINISTERING
Jesus calls us o'er tumult

Jesus calls us: o'er the tumult
Of our life's wild, restless sea;
Day by day His sweet voice soundeth
Saying, 'Christian, follow me.'

Jesus calls us from the worship
Of the vain world's golden store,
From each idol that would keep us,
Saying, 'Christian, follow me.'

In our joys and in our sorrows,
Days of toil and hours of ease,
Still he calls, in cares and pleasures,
'Christain, love me more than these.'

Jesus calls us: by thy mercies,
Saviour, may we hear thy call,
Give our hearts to thine obedience,
Serve and love thee best of all.
