DESIRE

I am yours
you are mine

Take my heart and my mind

Open the eyes of my heart
Reveal yourself lord

I want you
it

Oh oh oh
You are my desire

Hear this song from my heart

We want more open our minds

Let us understand
The sentiment of your heart

Pour out your spirit LORD

I'M AMAZED

Verse1
Lonely how  lonely I was feeling

And the emptiness I try so hard to hide

Though I laughed and said my life
Is fine without you

I was covering up the secret tears I cried

Then one day someone told me
Of your mercy and the love

You showed that day on calvary

There you died just because of my redemption

When you broke sin

Chorus
I

I

Through your precious blood
I find pardon

All my sins are washed
They

All my sins are washed away

Verse2
Yes it
When I

Lord you know that many times
I have gone astray

But I
Than my weakness

And you re-resolved everytime I pray

No one else has ever care for me like you lord

All the friends can never be as close to me

I

Knowing you are everything I

Chorus
I

I

Through your precious blood
I find pardon

All my sins are washed
They

All my sins are washed away
