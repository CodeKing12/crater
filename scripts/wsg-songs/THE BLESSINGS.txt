MINISTERING
THE BLESSINGS

The Lord has made

A covenant with you

He has promised..

That he would bless you

You are in the earth

But you live,
above..

The curse

You are kingdom,

You have rights

Blessings come with no struggle or fight

So when recession comes

You won't be affected

When sickness comes

You will have good health

The dollar may fail

Your wealth will increase

War all around

You will be at peace

The  blessing

Is on you

God's promise to you

So why do you worry

About what's coming next

Before you were born

You were destined to live blessed

You are kingdom

You have rights

blessings come
With no struggle
or fight

A kingdom citizen  you are

You are blessed

Both near and far

So when recession comes

You won't be affected

When sickness comes

I guarantee you will be in good health

The dollar may fail

Your wealth will increase

War all around

You will be at peace
