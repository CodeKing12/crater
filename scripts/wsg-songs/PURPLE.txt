MINISTERING
PURPLE

When we praise heaven responds with open arms

When we praise heaven abides within your heart

Praise unlocks the door it breaks every chain

Praise releases dreams it's all in his name

Just praise through your success and through the day

Just praise through the day, yes through the rain

Beyond every dark cloud, Beyond all fear and doubt

Theres a blessing, a promise awaiting in your praise

When we praise God will do the impossible
[impossible]

Just have faith He can do the improvable

Tell of his awesome works, Speak well of his name

Jesus, oh Lamb of God forever shall reign

Just praise through your success and through the day

Just praise through the day, yes through the rain

Beyond every dark cloud, Beyond all fear and doubt

Theres a blessing, a promise awaiting in your praise

We lift our voices in one accord

Singing these praises to you oh Lord

Oh, Oh, Oh

There is no one, No one like Thee, Holy, Holy

Praise him, Worship Him, Gonna Clap, Gonna Dance, Gonna Shout,

Gonna just lift my voice and

Praise Him, Worship Him, Gonna Clap, Gonna Dance, Gonna Shout

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Just praise, Just Praise, Just Praise

Just praise, Just Praise, Just Praise

Just praise through your success and through the day

Just praise through the day,
yes through the rain

Beyond every dark cloud, Beyond all fear and doubt

Beyond every dark cloud,
Beyond all fear and doubt

Beyond every dark cloud, Beyond all fear and doubt

There's a blessing, a promise awaiting in your praise
