WORD SANCTUARY CHOIR
MINISTERING
I SING FOR YOU


No mountain's too high

No valley's too low

That can take me away from your Love

When I sing forth my song

It goes unto your name

I will praise you Lord and sing all my days


I sing for you

I dance for you

All I ever want to do is all for you

I move for  you

I live for you

All I ever want to do is all for you



You are my strength and my shield

My guardian and Friend

Unto me O GOD


You are the Ancient of days

You're the reason why I sing

Oh Oh GOD its all for You
