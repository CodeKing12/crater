JOY

Joy, Joy, Joy, sweet Joy

Joy, Joy, down in my soul
Sweet beautiful soul saving joy

Oh Joy, Joy in my soul

Listen to the music

The sound of the angels

Come and see the child

Who can make you hope

Lying in a manger

Away from harm and danger

Oh Joy, Joy in my soul

Oh Joy, Joy in my soul

Joy, Joy, Joy, sweet joy

Joy, Joy, down in my soul

Sweet beautiful soul saving joy

Oh Joy, Joy in my soul

He sent from up above

This special gift of love

More precious than silver or gold

He was sent this holy day

To take our pain away

Oh Joy, Joy in my soul

Oh Joy, Joy in my soul

Go tell it on the mountain

Shout it from a valley

Tell about the baby in swaddling clothes

Men in every nation

Join the celebration

Oh Joy, Joy in my soul

Oh Joy, Joy in my soul


Way down deep inside my soul, joy

Joy, Joy, Joy

I've got Joy

Said that way down deep Joy

Joy, Joy, Joy

I've got Joy

We've got deep Joy

Unspeakable Joy

In my soul
