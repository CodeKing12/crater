The Breathe of God, is my strength

The Life of Christ, is The Life that I live

The Word of God, resides in me

Spirit of God, illuminate me

The Fire of God, burns in me

The Light of Christ, is shinning through me

The glory of God, is over me

Spirit of God, transfiguring me

I Have it...
The power of the Holy Ghost

I Live it...
The presence of the Holy Ghost


Now I walk in your light

Now I walk with no fear

I Have it...
The power of the Holy Ghost
