There is a place

That I love to dwell

It's the presence of my

Father

All the host of heaven gather Worshiping, bowing down

before Him Holy holy holy  Hallelujah

I know a name

That's full of grace

Its the name above all other

Jesus Christ

The lion of Judah

Worshipping

Bowing down before him

I have more than a song

Today I brought myself

I am the sacrifice

I have more than a song

Today

I brought myself

I am Your worship

Lord receive

This living sacrifice

I am your worship

Leave me at the alter with my father

Hallelujah

To God

Most high

Most high

You are the God of heaven

Most high

Ruler of the earth

Most high

King of nations

Hallelujah

To God

Most high

You are glorious

So glorious in your way

Yahweh Yahweh
