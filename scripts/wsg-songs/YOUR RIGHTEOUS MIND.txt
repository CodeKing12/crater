MINISTERING
YOUR RIGHTEOUS MIND

If ye be risen
Risen...

Risen in Christ in Christ

Set your affections
Affections

On the things of the kingdom

Whatsoever things are true

Whatsoever things are honest

Whatsoever things are just

Whatsoever things are pure

Whatsoever lovely

What's the report of the renewing of your mind

Your righteous mind...

Let this mind that's in Christ Jesus

Be in you
Be in you

Guard your hearing

Guard your seeing

Guard your speaking

Guard your heart

Your righteous mind...

Let this mind that's in Christ Jesus

Be in you

Let go of your natural thinking

Embrace your righteous mind

Your righteous mind...
