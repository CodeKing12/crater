I was searching
For an answer

To the question in my heart
Wondering if I was a part

Of something greater
Something better

No direction in my path
confusion all around

You came through
When i was lost alone and confused

You came through
And you stayed

Yes, you transformed
Every situation around

Now I see
As you see

I'm transformed by you
I've been made brand new

Since you came
I've been changed

No more sin and shame
You took it all away

since you came
my life changed
