As the way the dew is to the ground
As the way the fire is to the coal
Rest upon my heart
Rest upon my altar
Rest upon the fabrics of my heart

As the way the water is to the sea
As the way the a milk is to the baby/infant
Rest upon my heart
Rest upon my altar
Rest upon the fabrics of my heart

Fresh fire
Fresh fire
Fresh fire
Fresh fire

Take my heart and let it be
Consecrated unto you
Oh, take my heart and let it be
As a pleasing/living sacrifice

Fresh fire
Upon my heart
Fresh fire
Upon my altar
Fresh fire
Fresh fireeeeee

I don
Look back when you come
I don
Look back when you come
