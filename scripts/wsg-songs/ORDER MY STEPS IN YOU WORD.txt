ORDER MY STEPS IN YOUR WORD

Order my steps in Your words dear Lord

Lead me,
Guide me everyday

Send Your anointing,
Father I pray

Order my steps in Your word

Humbly,I ask thee teach me your will

While you are working,
wanna be still

Cos satan is busy,
God is real

Order my steps in your word

Bridle my tongue let my words edify

Let the words of my mouth be acceptable in your sight

Take charge of my words both day and night

Order my steps in thy word

Order my steps in your words dear lord

Lead me,
Guide me everyday

Send your anointing,
Father I pray

Order my steps in your word

I walk worthy

According to thy will

Please order my steps Lord

And I'll do your blessed will

The world is ever changing

But you are still the same

Lord order my steps,
I'll praise your name

Order my steps in your word

Order my tongue in your word

Guide my feet in your word

Wash my heart in your word

Show me how to talk in your word

Show me how to walk in your word

When I need a brand new song to sing

Show me how to let your praises ring

In your word,
in your word

Please order my steps in your word

Please order my steps in your word
