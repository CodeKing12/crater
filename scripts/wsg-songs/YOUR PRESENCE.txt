Who is like You Lord in all the earth

Matchless love and beauty endless worth

Nothing in this world will satisfy

Jesus You're the cup that won't run dry

Treasure of my heart and of my soul

In my weakness You are merciful

Redeemer of my past and present wrongs

Holder of my future days to come

All my days on earth I will await

The moment that I see You face to face

Nothing in this world will satisfy

Cause Jesus You're the cup that won't run dry

Your presence is heaven to me

Your presence is heaven to me

All I want is to be with You

There's nothing like Your presence, Lord

All I want is to worship You

You are God

You got times and seasons in your hand

You call for light out of darkness

You don't need a man to be the God you are.

You have chosen to call me your own

TAG
You are God from beginning to the end

There's no place for argument

You are God all by yourself
