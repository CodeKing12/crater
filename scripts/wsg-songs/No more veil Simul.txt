Jesus took my sin, sufferings all for free

So that I might be closer unto Him

In my place Jesus stood the gap for me

Presenting me to God holy

Now I am fit to walk in His presence and glory


No more veil
No more limitation

I can now see Jesus face to face

No more veil
No more limitation

I can now see Jesus face to face

The price has been paid
The blood has made a way for me

I can now see Jesus face to face

The price has been paid
The blood has made a way for me

I can now see Jesus face to face

I

I

I could not come boldly into Your presence

But Your blood has made a way
