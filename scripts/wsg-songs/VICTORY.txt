verse1
I tought i lost
But actually i won

For by his blood
we all have overcome

there is no failure
Our God can never loose

And that same power it now belongs to you

chorus
Now it's time to celebrate all banners raised

I've got a victory,
got victory

Because the devil is defeated and God be praised

I've got a victory,
got victory

Every situation i face i win

I've got a victory,
got victory

And everything works for my good in the end

I've got a victory,
got victory

verse2
I was on my
way to burning hell

The devil he had my life set up to fail

But thanks
be to my God who causes me to

Triumph overcome tread upon the enemy

Now it's time to celebrate all banners raised

I've got a victory,
got victory

Because The devil is defeated and God be praised

I've got a victory,
got victory

Every situation i face i win

I've got a victory,
got victory

And everything works for my good in the end

I've got a victory,
got a victory

verse3
Some body who's listening
Right now you think you're loosing

You feel like you can't win
Cos you've tried everything

Greater is he that lives in you
You dont doubt

Whatever you're in now
God says you have to come out

chorus
Now it's time to celebrate all banners raised

I've got a victory,
got victory

Because the devil is defeated and God be praised

I've got a victory,
got victory

Every situation i face i win

I've got a victory,
got victory

And everything works for my good in the end

I've got a victory,
got victory

I've got a victory,
got victory

I'VE GOT THE

VICTORY
