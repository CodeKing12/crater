SURROUNDED BY HOLY

Take me into Your secret place

Where I'm constantly amazed

Where the saints and angels bow before You

There's nothing like Your presence

It's just a glimpse of Heaven

There, where the elders throw their crowns before You

Holy, surrounded by holy

There's no one more holy

I'm in wonder and awe

In wonder and awe

King who is wrapped in majesty

You alone will always be

All creation joins

With Heaven singing

Holy, surrounded by holy

There's no one more holy

I'm in wonder and awe

In wonder and awe

Holy, surrounded by holy

There's no one more holy

I'm in wonder and awe

In wonder and awe

The more that I enter in,

You consume all I am

I lose myself in the One

Who's holy

As we come face to face,

You take my breath away

All I can do

Is cry holy, holy

The more that I enter in,

You consume all I am

I lose myself

In the One who's holy

As we come face to face,

You take my breath away

All I can do is cry

Holy, surrounded by holy

There's no one more holy

I'm in wonder and awe

In wonder and awe

Holy, surrounded by holy

There's no one more holy

I'm in wonder and awe

In wonder and awe

The more that I enter in,

You consume all I am

I lose myself

In the One who's holy

As we come face to face,

You take my breath away

All I can do

Is cry holy, holy

Holy, surrounded by holy

There's no one more holy

I'm in wonder and awe

In wonder and awe

Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

There's no one more holy

There's no one more holy
