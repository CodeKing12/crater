Deep calls unto deep
Life calls unto life
Spirit calls unto spirit
I hear the sound of heaven over me

Purify my heart with your fire
Let dead things fall away
Purify my heart with your fire
That I may look like you

As the deer pants for the water
So my soul longs for you

Take away the scales
Let me see you clearly
Let me hear your Voice
When my Shepherd speaks
Touch my lips o lord
With your coals of Fire
Purify my heart
Make me just like you

Ah ah ah eh
Ah ah ah eh eh
Ah ah ah eh
Ah ah ah eh /2X

oh ho h
Ah ah ah eh eh
Ah ah ah eh
Ah ah ah eh /2X

There
Is calling me to deep deep waters  (2x)

Oh lord I
I
Oh let your rivers roll over me

So my soul longs for you (2x)

There
fountain springing  up inside of me
It
life eternal

There
