VERSE1
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,

Let me hide myself in Thee;

Let the water and the blood,

From Thy riven side which flowed,

Be of sin the double cure,

Cleanse me from its guilt and power.

VERSE2
Not the labor of my hands

Can fulfill Thy law

Could my zeal no respite know,

Could my tears forever flow,

All could never sin erase,

Thou must save, and save by grace.

VERSE3
Nothing in my hands I bring,

Simply to Thy cross I cling;

Naked, come to Thee for dress,

Helpless, look to Thee for grace:

Foul, I to the fountain fly,

Wash me, Savior, or I die.

VERSE4
While I draw this fleeting breath,

When mine eyes shall close in death,

When I soar to worlds unknown,

See Thee on Thy judgment throne,

Rock of Ages, cleft for me,

Let me hide myself in Thee.

TAG2
VERSE1
My hope is built on nothing less

Than Jesus' blood and righteousness

I dare not trust the sweetest frame

But wholly lean on Jesus' name

CHORUS
On Christ the solid rock I stand

All other ground is sinking sand

All other ground is sinking sand

VERSE2
When darkness veils His lovely face

I'll rest on His unchanging grace

In every high and stormy day

My anchor holds within the veil

CHORUS
On Christ the solid rock I stand

All other ground is sinking sand

All other ground is sinking sand

VERSE3
His oath, His covenant, His blood

Support me in the whelming flood

When all around my soul gives way

He then is all my hope and stay

CHORUS
On Christ the solid rock I stand

All other ground is sinking sand

All other ground is sinking sand

VERSE4
When He shall come with trumpet sound

Oh, may I then in Him be found

Dressed in His righteousness alone

Faultless to stand before the throne

CHORUS
On Christ the solid rock I stand

All other ground is sinking sand

All other ground is sinking sand
