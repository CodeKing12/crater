You are Good, you are kind
You are more than these
I'm lost for Words trying to describe
Elohim, El-elyon, Aleselewi
Your Greatness is all I see

There is nothing you cannot do
There's no mountain you cannot
If you have said it
Then you will do it
Cause You have a Track record
Of keeping Words
And you're not about
To stop doing it now

Olorun Agbaye oh
(You are Mighty oh)
Olorun Agbaye oh, oh
(You are Mighty oh)
Shebi iwo lo f'oju Orun
(S'aso bora)
Shebi eyin le f'oju Orun
(S'aso bora)
Olorun Agbaye oh,
(You are Mighty oh)

By the Blood that you shed
We have overcome
Discharged and acquitted for life
Then you gave us the right
To your Holy Name
The center of Power and Strength
There is nothing you cannot Change

There's no bondage you cannot Break
If you have said it
Then you will do it
You have a Track record
Of keeping Words
And you're not about
To stop doing it now

Shebi iwo lo f'oju Orun
(S'aso bora)
Shebi eyin le f'oju Orun
(S'aso bora)
Olorun Agbaye oh,
(You are Mighty oh)

Resp: He will do it
