MINISTERING
OHUN GBOGBO LOLE SE

verse 1
I know a man

A king enthrone

Who laid his life for you and I

He paid the price to give atone

On the cross of calvary

He lives in me

He lives in you

All power belong to him

He lives in me

He lives in you

There is nothing he cannot do

CHORUS
Ohun gbogbo lolese

verse 2
Oku lorigi agbelegbu o

Ojiya ese tin be je

Owa saye lati gbamila

Oba aiku ojinde

He lives in me

He lives in you

All power belong to him

He lives in me

He lives in you

There is nothing he cannot do

verse 3
You are my healer ... you heal my pain

You are my helper ... a present help

You became a servant to make me king

My ever present help in time of need
