Jesus came with one mission:

To make you become Him so you fulfil God's will on earth.
He came to extend His authority to you...YES YOU!

Revelation 1:5
And from Jesus Christ, [who is] the faithful witness,

[and] the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth.

Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,

He extended his authority, power and dominion to you when

He made you a King and Priest unto God His Father...forever!

So now, you are no longer a slave, you are made a King...
Ordained a Priest unto God! Wow!

Do you know what this means?

You walk with the consciousness that your spirit has been merged with the Spirit of God...

His influence is now working in and through you...yes, YOU!

So that when YOU speak, it is God speaking, when YOU walk,

it is God walking, when YOU take charge, it is God dominating!

As a PRIEST, you become the express image of God...

As KING, you have the dominion of God to accomplish God

original intention...reigning over the Nations with Christ!

YOU, a KING by divine enthronement...

Being one with the Lord,

Your words carry the full authority and effect of God

So now, rise up
Step up,

Walk majestically,
Use your words, take dominion...

Did I hear you say 'I don't think I'm qualified'?
1 Peter 2:9 But ye [are] a chosen generation, a royal priesthood,

an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of

him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:

No!
YOU are a chosen generation,
YOU are Royal priesthood,

YOU are Holy,
YOU are a Peculiar Person...

Called out of darkness into God's marvellous light...

You see...

YOU are a KING
YOU are a PRIEST

Unto the Nations forever!

You have this experience when you get saved so,

Confess Jesus as your Lord and believe He is your savior...
That's it!

Take hold of your office from now...

Preach, teach and live the Word of God...

You are now called a kingdom of Priests!
