SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

Olorun to da awon
Oke igbani

Eyin ni mo fi
Ope e mi fun

Tani un o tun gbega oo
Bi ko se baba loke

Tani un o tun fi gbogbo ope mi fun

You alone art worthy Lord,
To be praised and adored

You've been faithful LORD,
From the ages past

That is why your name is forevermore

There's no one,
There's no one Like Jesus

There's no one,
There's no one like Him

I waka waka
(No one, no one)

I searched and searched Him
(No one, no one)

I turn around
(No one, no one)

There's no one,
There's no one Like Him

Tshela moya, tshela moya
Tshela moya o halelelang

Cast your burdens unto Jesus
For he cares for you

Higher higher higher higher higher higher  higher,
Lift Jesus higher

Lower lower lower lower lower lower lower,
Step satan lower

Atewo ni mo fi a mo
Bi o ba m'ore

Mo m'ore o
(Mo m'ore)
