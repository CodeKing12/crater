What a Friend we have in
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry,
Everything to God in prayer!

Oh, what peace we often
Oh, what needless pain we
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer!


Have we trials and
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Can we find a friend so
Who will all our sorrows
Jesus knows our every
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
