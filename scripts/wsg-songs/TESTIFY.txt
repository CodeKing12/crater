TESTIFY

From the time in memorial

You have refused to change

You're always the same

Yesterday and today, tomorrow

From the works of your hands

Nobody fit deny

Say You be ogboghe baba

You don make our lives better

You are good

You are good

You are good

I will lift up my eyes to the hills

From whence cometh my help

Oh it comes from the Lord

Maker of heaven and earth

Na him they make me kampe

He breath his breath of life to me

We stand gidigba

Atoba jaiye lemi yo ma sin titi aye
(The Preeminent One will I serve for eternity)

Eze ndi eze onye na'bia ozo chimo
(King of kings, the one that is to come)
