WORD SANCTUARY CHOIR
MINISTERING
IN THE TEMPLE

In the lord's house we are

singing blessed be his name

and his glory in this sanctuary

is the reason why we're here

I will give him my whole heart

I will give him my whole strength

just to show forth the praises of him

In the TEMPLE

Sing praises unto the Lord

Declare among his people his doings

My soul doth magnify the Lord

Oh oh oh oh
The praises of the Lord is in my heart

My soul doth magnify the lord


We've been washed

We've been sanctified and blessed

We are blessed

oh oh blessed
