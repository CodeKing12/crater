A song for my beloved...

Broken and empty,

Tears from my slavery,

Jesus you took the cross for me,

Now redeemed from sin,

Now I'm passed from death to life,

All because you paid with your life.

Bridge
Now, you've called me to preach the gospel to everyone one

To reign with you and now I see,

Your love is all that I need,

Your love is all for me,

Your love is my sanctuary,

Your love is all for me.

Now I'm filled with joy,

You give me peace and joy,

You feed me with your love,

I want more.

No, I cannot sleep,

I love to be with thee,

Jesus I love you ooo.

Your ascension made available your precious gift

The gift of your precious holy name,

Your name is all that I need,

You name is my Sanctuary,

Your name is all that I need,

Your name is all for me.

Oh, Jesus I am lovesick,

And my heart keep yearning for thee,

From the sunrise to the evening,

I keep thinking about thee.

Jesus saves,

Jesus saves,

Jesus saves,

Call his name.

I have received him into my heart,

He saved me,

No longer afraid of my past,

He saved me,

From all my troubles and all my doubts,

He saved me.

He saved me,

He saved Me.

I love you,

I reverence you,

I adore you,

I worship you.
