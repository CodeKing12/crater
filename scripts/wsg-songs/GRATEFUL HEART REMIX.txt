WORD SANCTUARY MASS CHOIR INT
MINISTERING
GRATEFUL HEART REMIX

VERSE1
Step to the floor step to the show

In this house we are gathered to celebrate to jubilate

When I ponder on His wonder

I feel so speechless I wonder

I came to His presence this time around
With A grateful heart

CHORUS
A grateful heart
A grateful heart
A grateful heart
A grateful heart

VERSE2
Now we celebrate the joy of God
In our heart

We will rejoice and be glad of the victory
You

You gave us life to live and our heart
Rejoice

CHORUS
A grateful heart
A grateful heart
A grateful heart
A grateful heart

BRIDGE
So great but
forgot his age

and came as a little baby, little baby

Left his glory
step down to groaning

took my place and now I am free

CHORUS
A grateful heart
A grateful heart
A grateful heart
A grateful heart

BRIDGE
So great but
forgot his age

and came as a little baby, little baby

Left his glory
step down to groaning

took my place and now I am free
