Oh Lord, you're
Your face is all I seek
For when your eyes are
Your grace abounds to
Your grace abounds to

I want to take your
But first help me to

And when I'm doing
For my reward is giving

Oh Lord, please light
That once burned
Replace the lamp of my
That burns with holy

Oh Lord, you're
Your face is all I see
For when your eyes are
on
