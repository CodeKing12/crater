There's a void in my soul
No one can fill it
No one can fill it

Jesus come take your place No one can fill it
No one can fill it

I have this void in my soul
No one can fill it
No one can fill it

Jesus come, make it quick
No one can fill it
No one can fill it

Yahweh come, make it quick
No one can fill it
No one can fill it
