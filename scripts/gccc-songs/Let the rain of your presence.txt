Let the rain of your presence fall on me
Everyday that I live
With every breathe I breathe

Let the rain of your presence fall on me
Everywhere that I go
Lord let your presence flow
Rain on me

Let the rain of your presence fall on me
Everyday that I live
With every breathe I breathe

Let the rain of your presence fall on me
Everywhere that I go
Lord let your presence flow
Rain on me
