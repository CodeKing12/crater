The line are falling
they are in pleasant places
The lord is my portion
I have a Godly inheritance

I have a Godly inheritance


Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oooooooh oooooh
Ah ah ah ah ah
Aaah aaaah aaaah
Eh eh eh eh eh
Eeeh eeeh eeeeh

It
It
It
Says the spirit of the lord
I am free
I am free
I am free
I am free
Says the spirit of the lord

I will shout
I will shout
I will shout
I will shout
Says the spirit of the lord

I have life
I have life
I have life
I have life
Says the spirit of the lord

It
Even the enemy knows
And it
From the heavens from up above
