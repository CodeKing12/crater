MINISTERING
I AM (MIRACLE)

I heard

You were
(you were)

Wondering
(wondering if God still answers prayer)

I heard
(I heard)

That you were
(that you were)

Searching for a sign
(searching for a sign)

That He was still right there

Every time you shake my hand oh yeah

Every time you see me dance oh yeah

You can tell by looking

But I ain't got time to tell ya

All you really need to know is

I'm a living, breathing, walking, talking, moving miracle

People said I'd never, they said I'd never ever but stop, look, watch

Cause I am,
I am...

Who lives in me and knows all things

Greater is he than what you see

If you need proof just look at me
