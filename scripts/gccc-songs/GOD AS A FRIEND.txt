I'm no longer on my own
I have Jesus in my camp
He chose me from the start
He has called by his name

He calls me friend
He brought me home
Shows me his heart
He is my shepherd
He holds me by the hand
Leads me to his flock
Shows me his heart
He is my shepherd

I'm not blinded by the world
Found a treasure in my Lord
He's closer than before
Forever I am one with him
