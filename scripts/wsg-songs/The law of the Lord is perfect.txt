The law of the Lord is perfect, Converting the soul

The testimony of the Lord is sure, Making wise the simple.

More to be desired are they than gold. Yea, than much fine gold

Sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb

The statutes of the Lord are right, Rejoicing the heart

The commandment of the Lord is pure, Enlightening the eyes.

The fear of the Lord is clean, Enduring forever

The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.

Let the words of my mouth And the meditation of my heart

Be acceptable in Thy sight, O Lord, My strength, and my redeemer.

Moreover by them is Thy servant warned: Is Thy servant warneD

And in keeping of them there is Great reward
