These are the days of Elijah

Declaring the word of the Lord yeah

And these are the days

Of your servant Moses

Righteousness being restored

These are the days of great trials

Of famine and darkness and sword

Still we are the voice

In the desert crying

Prepare ye the way of the Lord

Behold He comes

Riding on the clouds

Shinning like the sun

At the trumpet

Lift your voice

Year of Jubilee

Out of Zion

And these are the days of Ezekiel

The dry bones becoming flesh

And these are the days

Of your servant David

Rebuilding a temple of praise

And these are the days of the harvest

The fields are all white in Your world

And we are the labourers

That are in Your vineyard

Declaring the word of the Lord

Behold He comes

Riding on the clouds

Shinning like the sun

At the trumpet

Lift your voice

Year of Jubilee
