All these pieces, broken and
In mercy gathered, mended and
Empty-handed but not forsaken
I've been set free, I've been set free

Amazing grace, how sweet the
That saved a wretch like me,
I once was lost but now I am found
Was blind but now I see

Oh, I can see You now
Oh, I can see the love in Your eyes
Laying Yourself down
Raising up the broken to life

You take our failure, You take
You set Your treasure in jars of
So take this heart, Lord, I'll be
The world to see, Your life in me

Amazing grace, how sweet the
That saved a wretch like me,
I once was lost but now I am
Was blind but now I see

Oh, I can see You now
Oh, I can see the love in Your
Laying Yourself down
Raising up the broken to life

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Amazing grace, how sweet the
That saved a wretch like me,
I once was lost but now I am
Was blind but now I see

Oh, I can see You now
Oh, I can see the love in Your
Laying Yourself down
Raising up the broken to life
