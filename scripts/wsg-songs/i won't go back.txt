MINISTERING
I WON'T GO BACK

Have been changed, healed,freed,delivered

Have found joy,peace,grace and favour

And right now is the moment

To day is the day.

Have been changed
Have been changed

I have waited for this moment to pass

And won't let it pass me by

I won't go back
I can't go back

To the way it used to be

Before your presence come and changed me.

Never going back

I am never going back

To the way it was.
