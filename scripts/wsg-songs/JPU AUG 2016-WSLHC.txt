MINISTERING...

I see the cloud, I step in

I want to see your glory as Moses did

Flashes of light and rolls of thunder

I'm not afraid

Show me your glory

Show me your glory my God

Show me your glory

I'm marked by your beauty

Lost in your eyes

I want to walk in your presence like Jesus did

Your glory surrounds me

And I'm overwhelmed

I'm not afraid

Show me your glory

Show me your glory my God

Show me your glory

I long to look on the face of the one that I love

Long to stay in your presence is where I belong

Oh how we love You
