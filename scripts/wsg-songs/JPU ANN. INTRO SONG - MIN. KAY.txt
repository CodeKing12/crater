Crowds have lined the narrow street

To see this man from Galilee

Just a carpenter some say, leading fools astray

Yet many kneel to give Him praise

And in His eyes, they glimpse the power

That sees the heart of all men

And He knows His Father's mind

He speaks His Father's words

For He comes in the name of the Lord

There is strength in the name of the Lord

There is power in the name of the Lord

There is hope in the name of the Lord

Blessed is He, who comes in the name of the Lord

When my plans have fallen through

And when my strength is nearly gone

When there's nothing left to do but just depend on You

And the power of Your name

And as we call upon Your name

Your strength through weakness to show

We can know the masters plan extend the masters hand

When we come in the name of the Lord

There is strength in the name of the Lord

There is power in the name of the Lord

There is hope in the name of the Lord

Blessed is He, who comes in the name of the Lord

His name will be worshiped forever

Creator, Redeemer and King

There is strength in the name of the Lord

There is power in the name of the Lord

And there is hope in the name of the Lord

Blessed is He, who comes, blessed is He, who comes

Blessed is He, who comes in the name of the Lord

In the name of the Lord, in the name of the Lord
