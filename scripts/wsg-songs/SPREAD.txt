Darkness everywhere

Sadness in my heart


I was so down until you came

And now that you're here

All my pain is gone

My heart...is so filled with light

TAG
And now am your own

Forever I am yours

Nothing is stronger than this love

Your light shines around me

And even in my heart

Nothing will take this from me....

TAG
This light you gave

This love you've shown

Oh I'll spread it everywhere

Oh I'll share it everywhere
