Oh oh oh... oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh... oh oh oh oh

Singing HOLY, HOLY, HOLY

Oh OBA
(Oh King)

Kings have come and kings have gone

Thrones and rulers disappear

But YOUR KINGDOM REIGNS FOREVER

Oh OBA
(Oh King)

Before time LORD YOU EXISTED

YOU spoke the world into existence

YOU are GOD and YOU are KING

We Call YOU

OBA
(King)

OBA Awon Oba
(King of Kings)

YOUR KINGDOM REIGNS FOREVER

Oh OBA
(Oh King)

Angels bow before YOUR THRONE

All The Elders Cast Their Crowns

Singing HOLY, HOLY, HOLY

Oh OBA
(Oh Oba)

We have come to give YOU WORSHIP

Bowing down before THE KING

Singing HOLY, HOLY, HOLY

Oh OBA
(Oh King)
