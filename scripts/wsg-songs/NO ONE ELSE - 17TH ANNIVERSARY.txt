I am standing on the rock

Though the tides may come

I have put my trust in only you

I am standing tall

I am standing on your word

Dancing on the waves

I am only moved by what you say

So my soul will sing

Through the years

You have seen my tears

You are always here

You are always here

All my days

You have seen my frame

Lord you know my name

You know my name

Like no one else could do

No one else could do

You've been watching over me like no one else could do

I'm reigning

I'm burning

I'm soaring on eagle's wings

Your love has preserved me

I won't be the same again

Like no one else could do

No one else could do

You've been watching over me like no one else could do
