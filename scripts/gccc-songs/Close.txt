Chorus 1
Draw me near to where You are
And lead me Lord direct my heart
'Cause I want to be
Where You need me most
Draw me bring me close

Verse 1
I come before You God
I toss my flesh aside
So You can use me
I strip my soul down bare
Shout to You this prayer
Please work through me

Verse 2
Kick down all my walls
Come with Your wrecking ball
So I can see You
Give me ears to hear
Your voice so loud and clear
Lord I need You
