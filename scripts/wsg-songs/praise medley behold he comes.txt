These are the days of Elijah,

Declaring the word of the Lord:

And these are the days of Your servant Moses,

Righteousness being restored.

And though these are days of great trial,

Of famine and darkness and sword,

Still, we are the voice in the desert crying

Prepare ye the way of the Lord

Behold He comes, riding on the clouds

Shining like the sun, at the trumpet call!

Lift your voice, it

And out of Zion

You are marvellous iyeh

You are marvellous iyeh

Marvellous iyeh

iyeh yeh yeh yeh

To you be all the glory

To you be all the glory
