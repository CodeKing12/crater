VERSE 1
When you're up against the struggle

That shatters all your dreams

And your hopes have been cruelly crushed

By Satan's manifested schemes

And you feel the urge within you to submit to earthly fear

Don't let the faith you're standing in seem to disappear

CHORUS
Praise the Lord

He will work through those who praise him

Praise the Lord

For our God inhabits praise

Praise the Lord

For the chains that seem to bind you

Serve only to remind you

That they drop powerless behind you

When you praise him

VERSE 2
Remember, remember that Satan is a liar

And he wants to make us think

That we are paupers (poor)

When he knows himself that we are children of the King

So lift up the mighty shield of faith

For the battle must be won

We know that Jesus Christ is risen

And the work's already done

CHORUS
So praise the Lord

He will work through those who praise him

Praise the Lord

For our God inhabits praise

Praise the Lord

For the chains that seem to bind you

Serve only to remind you

That they drop powerless behind you

When you praise him

Praise the Lord

He will work through those who praise him

Praise the Lord

Our God abides in our praise

Praise the Lord

For the chains that seem to bind you

Serve only to remind you

That they drop powerless behind you

When you praise him

Praise him

When you praise him

When you praise, the Lord

Praise the Lord
