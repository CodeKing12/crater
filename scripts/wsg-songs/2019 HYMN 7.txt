VERSE 1
o come all ye faithful. O come, all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant!
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem;
Come and behold him
Born the King of Angels:
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord.

VERSE 2
God of God,
light of light,
Lo, he abhors not the virgin's womb;
Very God,
begotten, not created:
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord.

VERSE 3
Sing, choirs of angels, sing in exultation,
Sing, all ye citizens of Heaven above!
Glory to God, glory in the highest:
O come, let us adore Him,
Christ the Lord.

verse 4
Yea, Lord, we greet thee, born this happy morning;
Jesus, to thee be glory given!
Word of the Father, now in flesh appearing!
O come, let us adore Him
Christ the Lord.
