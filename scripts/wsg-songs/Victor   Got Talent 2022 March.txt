At the heavenly  courtroom i was

standing all shamefully  before God  almighty  the  judge

i was least deserving not even an iota of mercy

was pinned down by shackels of sins  and was tightly chained by the  laws

and devil  the  chief persecutor

he  kept on showing evidence  upon evidence  with no space

neither  dividence for me to prove my innocent.

And God almighty  the  judge sitted

at his throne at his right hand was a mighty gavel of justice

i had no lawyer  was placed on trial although

i use to be on fire and sang in so many choirs

but for God i was too weak under the law.

I tell you pains from this chain ache deep down to my bone marrow

i look left right looking for a way to escape

not one  not even so narrow.

A glance at the serpent and it's  agent  they were

filled with jubilation  for to them this was my hour of tribulation

but wait, just as i was  about to receive  this judgement

they was an eruption in the sentence

i see God  the  judge, no i see love the judge i hear

him  speak his word i see the word took a bodily form

and becomes  a son, i saw him come into the courtroom

that night and took a lighter  the records id lying

cheating  i was on trial for he set ablaze  instantly

i was  made whole glory was all the angel could  say

as the word who took this bodily form took my place.

but just then i feel disgusted because  the son who

took this bodily becoming a son  is now disgruntled

i see him bleed the way that leds to golgotha i see men

laughs at him songs and their daughter's  i see him cry

to die, i see his father  feels relaxs and satisfy

i still join to shout crucify

i saw this man pay the price for me .

I see God  in his truest form, i see love in his truest form

i saw his skin deform,  i saw the bread of life gasping

for breath i see the river of living water dying for thirst,

i saw him gave up the ghost for me to have the holy Ghost,

for the  pages of my sins to be torn i saw on his head a crown of throngs,

for me to have koinonia i saw the veil torn,

For how broken and pierced was my feeling to feel,

but he took beaten and piercing on his hands and feet

for my sins to be cleansed  so i  ask what manner  of

love will make the father die in place of his son,

what manner of love will make a king die in place of the accused,

what manner of love will make the judge die in place of the accused

have we become so ignorant to know that love is not

only an action word but a transaction, we've  become so
blind to see that love is not blind for how can the

healer of the blind heal others of their blindness and

not heal him self, we've  become so deaf to hear love

is no a commandment  but a way of live for how do we

claim to be christ like and not lovelike

So lord i come to you in your finish work that your

strength be made fit in my weakness that you take this

filthy fleshy garment of survival of the fittest for a garment of meekness,

cleaningness and holiness.. i come surrendering this

demon religion demonstration to answer to this faith

that my past be being fade i may behold you face to face

So i pray may i not, may you not  claim to know this john 3:16 lover

and the last day ends in his wrath may you not may i not....
