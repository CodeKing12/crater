Oh ho ho ho

Jesus walks Jesus walks

Jesus walks with me

I want Jesus to walk with me

I want Jesus to walk with me

While i'm on this Pilgrim journey,

I want Jesus to walk with me.

He walks with my Mother

He walks with me

He walks with my Father yeah

He walks with me

While i'm on this Pilgrim journey,

I want Jesus to walk with me.

Jesus walks with me with me.......

verse
To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers even the swindlers.

(Jesus walks for them)

To the victims of welfare for we live in hell then, hell yeah

(Jesus walks for them)

Now, hear ye, hear ye, want to see thee more clearly

I know He hears me when my feet get weary

'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct

We rap as role models, we rap n do think

I ain't here to argue about His facial features

We here to convert atheists into believers

I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers

The way people need reasons, that's the way I need Jesus

So here go my single, dawg, radio needs us

They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus

That means guns, sex, lies, videotape

But if I talk about God, my record won't get played.

huh?

Jesus walks

God showed me the way but the devil's tryna Break down

Jesus walks with me

The only thing that I pray is that my feet won't fail me now.

Jesus walks

And if you think there nothing you could do now to right your wrongs.

Jesus walks with me with me.....

I wanna talk to God but I am afraid he's always been speaking.

bridge
I want Jesus to walk with me

I need Jesus to walk with me.

When i'm on my pilgrim journey.

I need Jesus to walk with me.

He walks with my Mother he walks with me

He walks with my Father he walks with me

When i'm on this Pilgrim journey,

I need Jesus to walk with me.

Jesus walks with me with me.......
