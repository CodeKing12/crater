THE MASTER HAS CALLED US

VERSE 1
The Master has come, and He calls us to follow
The track of the footprints He leaves on our way;
Far over the mountain and through the deep hollow,
The path leads us on to the mansions of day:

The Master has called us, the children who fear Him,
Who march
We love Him and seek Him, we are one and in him
And rest in the light of His beautiful land.

VERSE 2
The Master has called us; the road o'er no dread,
no dangers and sorrows are strewn on the track;
But our  Holy Spirit has strengthened us all
We follow the Savior and cannot turn back;

The Master has called us, though tests and tribulation
May compass our journey, we cheerfully sing:
â€œ
The children of Zion must follow the King.

VERSE 3
The Master has called us, in life
With spirits as fresh as the dew on the sod:
We turn from the world, with its smiles and its scorning,
To live in the kigdom as children of God

The Master has called us, His sons and His daughters,
We live in His blessing and one in his love;
And through the green pastures, beside the still waters,
We are living his life for his kingdom we are
