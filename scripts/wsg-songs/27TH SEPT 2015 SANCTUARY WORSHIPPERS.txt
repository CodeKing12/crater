SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

Jesus my whole life is yours,
Each and every breath

Jesus you are the sweetest of song,
None could ever stop

So I praise you more kabiyesi

Celebrate your love afenitan ni o o

Jesus your love is my crown,
I wear it now

Jesus you cause me to shine,
From your holy heights

So I praise you more kabiyesi

Celebrate your love afenitan ni o o

Kabiyesi afenitan ni o o

kabiyesi how total is your love

Mere jirie oghene me (I will praise my God)

O yovo mere lele (Him alone will I serve/follow)

Ne re swo ole Halleluyah Oghene me
(I will sing a song of Halleluyah to my God)

Ole Halleluyah ne re swo oghene me

Ole Halleluyah ne re swo

Ki jesu me

Who am I to sing your praises

Who am I to worship you

It

And make your way to enter into your throne

I could not come near your presence

I could never sing your song

But that sacrifice on Calvary tree

Is the reason why I can cry out today
