SANCTUARY WORSHIPPERS

At the centre of it all

It

At the centre of it all

It


You made my life so beautiful

You turned my darkness into light

You picked me up from the miry clay

Amazing God, Amazing king Ooooo


Ten thousand words not good enough to
praise you

Ten thousand tongues wouldn't be enough
to love you

Oh how great you've been to me

Amazing God  Amazing king


Eee Yahweh eeeee

Oh Oh Oh Oh

Eee Yahweh  eeeee

Amazing God, Amazing king

You are indeed my all in all

You are my well in dessert place

Oh king of kings and Lord of Lords,

Amazing God, Amazing king


Amazing God, Amazing king....
