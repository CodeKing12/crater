verse
He paid the debt
He did not owe

I owe the debt I could not pay
I needed someone to wash my sins away

now I can sing a brand new song amazing grace...

Christ Jesus paid the debt
i could never pay

chorus
so I praise you more...kabiesi
celebrate your love... afenitan ni o o

kabiesi afenitan ni o o
kabiesi how total is your love

verse
I cannot bow before God and bow before men
no way no way

I cannot sing before God and sing before men
no way no way

you are my God

verse
yes we lift you above all other gods
we lay our crowns and worship you

Glorious God we praise your name
we lay our crowns and worship you

I put my trust in you
I put my trust in you

Your Word is yea and Amen
Your Word is yea and Amen
