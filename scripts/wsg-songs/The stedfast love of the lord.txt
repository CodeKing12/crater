The Steadfast Love Of The Lord Never Ceases,
His Mercies Never Come To An End,

They Are New Every Morning, New Every Morning
Great Is Thy Faithfulness (Oh Lord)

Great Is Thy Faithfulness

As We Gather May Your Spirit Work Within Us
As We Gather May We Glorify Your Name
Knowing Well That As Our Hearts Begin To Worship
We
We

The Steadfast Love Of The Lord Never Ceases,
His Mercies Never Come To An End,
They Are New Every Morning, New Every Morning
Great Is Thy Faithfulness (Oh Lord)
Great Is Thy Faithfulness
