He has broken the gates of brass
And sawn the bars of iron asunder
He has broken the gates of brass
And sawn the bars of iron asunder

O that men would praise The Lord (2x)
For His goodness and for His wonderful works
To the children of men (2x)
For His goodness and for His wonderful works
To the children of men (2x)
