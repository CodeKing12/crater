I'll put You in front
In front of my melody

You're all that matters
You're all that matters

I'll make room for two
You and I Jesus

You're all that matters
You're all that matters

Owei, owei

You're all that matters
Owei, owei

You're all that matters
Owei, owei

You're all that matters
Owei, owei


What would I live for
If I don't have You in my life

What would I gain
If You take the Holy Ghost

What would have become of me
If I didn't see Your light

What would have been said of me
If You didn't hold my hands

Now I've come to realise.
That You are all I have

You're all that matters
You're all that matters

I'll put You in front
In front of my melody

You're all that matters
(All that matters)

You're all that matters
(I'll make room for two)

You and I Jesus
(You and I Jesus)


You're all that matters
(You and I Jesus)

You're all that matters


I'll put you in front
In front of my melody

You're all that matters
You're all that matters

I'll make room for two
You and I Jesus

You're all that matters
You're all that matters

Is it the car or is it the house
I'll give them all to You

Is it the name or is it the fame
I'm nothing without You

What would have become of me
If I didn't see Your light

What would have been said of me
If You did hold my hands

Now I've come to realise
That You are all I have

You're all that matters to me
You're all that matters, Jesus

I will put You in front
In front of my melody

You're all that matters
You're all that matters

I'll make room for two
You and I Jesus

You're all that matters
You're all that matters

I'll put You in front
In front of my melody

You're all that matters
You're all that matters

I'll make room for two
You and I Jesus

You're all that matters
(Only You and me)


Owei, owei
You're all that matters


You're all that matters



You are too faithful to fail me

You are too faithful to disappoint me

You've proven yourself in my life,
I've come to realize that you are too faithful to fail me

You are too committed to leave me,
You are too consistent to leave me half way

What you start you always finish,
I've come to testify that you are too faithful to fail me




You are my obsession, You are my heart's desire

You are my obsession, you are



i cling to God
