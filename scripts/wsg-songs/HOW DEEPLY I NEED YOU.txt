HOW DEEPLY I NEED YOU

verse1
Here is my heart
I give it LORD to you

Here is my life
I lay it before you

Where else would I go

And what else would I do

If I did not know you
Oh uh uh

How deeply I need you

How deeply I need you
My LORD

CHORUS
Like the desert needs the rain
I need you

Like the ocean needs the streams
I need you

Like the morning needs the sun
I need you

LORD you are my only one

I need you

In every way in every day
I need you
I need you
