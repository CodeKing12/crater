MINISTERING
MY HEART SINGS

how can I describe

the God that is indescribeable

how can I explain

your love that is unexplainable

I've even lost the word

Oh oh oh oh

My heart sings
oh oh oh

Praise praise praise

My heart sings
Praise praise praise

Grace Grace Grace

My heart sings
Grace Grace Grace

Uh uh uh

HIS WORD

I believe his word
I receive his word

He promised me a change
And I believe it

I proclaim his word
Standing on his word

He promised me a change
And I receive it


BRIDGE
No lack is in my life

Full healing

Everything

All of my past is gone

All hurt and pain is gone

Everything is changed for me

bridge
Everything is changed

Everything is changed for me

Everything is changed

Nothing is the same

Everything is changed for me
