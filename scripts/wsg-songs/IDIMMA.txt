CITY OF LOVE

I look around
I look beyond

I found no one like you

You all I want

You all I need

You all I want

You all I need to live

Verse1
City of love is the city where we live

City of wealth is the city where we live

Christ is the banner

Holiness is our uniform

Verse2
You made me more than just a man

Lord you made me super-natural

Am a let You know am leaning on You

Am a let the world know You are all I want
