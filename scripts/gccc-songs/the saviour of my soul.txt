You are saving me to the
oh oh oh
the saviour of my soul

The Lord is my light
and the light of my life
why should I be afraid

The Lord is my light
and the light of my life
I will not be afraid

I call upon his name
long before my troubles
I will not be afraid

we call upon his name
long before our troubles
we will not be afraid
